Brandeis’s series of articles on the money trust was\\nrunning in Harper’s Weekly many inquiries came about publication in\\nmore accessible permanent form. Even without such urgence through the\\nmail, however, it would have been clear that these articles inevitably\\nconstituted a book, since they embodied an analysis and a narrative\\nby that mind which, on the great industrial movements of our era, is\\nthe most expert in the United States. The inquiries meant that the\\nattentive public recognized that here was a contribution to history.\\nHere was the clearest and most profound treatment ever published on\\nthat part of our business development which, as President Wilson and\\nother wise men have said, has come to constitute the greatest of our\\nproblems. The story of our time is the story of industry. No scholar\\nof the future will be able to describe our era with authority unless\\nhe comprehends that expansion and concentration which followed the\\nharnessing of steam and electricity, the great uses of the change, and\\nthe great excesses. No historian of the future, in my opinion, will\\nfind among our contemporary documents so masterful an analysis of why\\nconcentration went astray. I am but one among many who look upon Mr.\\nBrandeis as having, in the field of economics, the most inventive and\\nsound mind of our time. While his articles were running in Harper’s\\nWeekly I had ample opportunity to know how widespread was the belief\\namong intelligent men that this brilliant diagnosis of our money trust\\nwas the most important contribution to current thought in many years.\\n\\n“Great” is one of the words that I do not use loosely, and I look upon\\nMr. Brandeis as a great man. In the composition of his intellect, one\\nof the most important elements is his comprehension of figures. As one\\nof the leading financiers of the country said to me, “Mr. Brandeis’s\\ngreatness as a lawyer is part of his greatness as a mathematician.”\\nMy views on this subject are sufficiently indicated in the following\\neditorial in Harper’s Weekly.\\n\\n  ARITHMETIC\\n\\n  About five years before the Metropolitan Traction Company of New\\n  York went into the hands of a receiver, Mr. Brandeis came down\\n  from Boston, and in a speech at Cooper Union prophesied that that\\n  company must fail. Leading bankers in New York and Boston were\\n  heartily recommending the stock to their customers. Mr. Brandeis\\n  made his prophecy merely by analyzing the published figures. How\\n  did he win in the Pinchot-Glavis-Ballinger controversy? In various\\n  ways, no doubt; but perhaps the most critical step was when he\\n  calculated just how long it would take a fast worker to go through\\n  the Glavis-Ballinger record and make a judgment of it; whereupon he\\n  decided that Mr. Wickersham could not have made his report at the\\n  time it was stated to have been made, and therefore it must have\\n  been predated.\\n\\n  Most of Mr. Brandeis’s other contributions to current history\\n  have involved arithmetic. When he succeeded in preventing a raise\\n  in freight rates, it was through an exact analysis of cost. When\\n  he got Savings Bank Insurance started in Massachusetts, it was\\n  by being able to figure what insurance ought to cost. When he\\n  made the best contract between a city and a public utility that\\n  exists in this country, a definite grasp of the gas business was\\n  necessary--combined, of course, with the wisdom and originality\\n  that make a statesman. He could not have invented the preferential\\n  shop if that new idea had not been founded on a precise knowledge\\n  of the conditions in the garment trades. When he established\\n  before the United States Supreme Court the constitutionality of\\n  legislation affecting women only, he relied much less upon reason\\n  than upon the amount of knowledge displayed of what actually\\n  happens to women when they are overworked--which, while not\\n  arithmetic, is built on the same intellectual quality. Nearly two\\n  years before Mr. Mellen resigned from the New Haven Railroad, Mr.\\n  Brandeis wrote to the present editor of this paper a private letter\\n  in which he said:\\n\\n  “When the New Haven reduces its dividends and Mellen resigns, the\\n  ‘Decline of New Haven and Fall of Mellen’ will make a dramatic\\n  story of human interest with a moral--or two--including the evils\\n  of private monopoly. Events cannot be long deferred, and possibly\\n  you may want to prepare for their coming.\\n\\n  “Anticipating the future a little, I suggest the following as an\\n  epitaph or obituary notice:\\n\\n  “Mellen was a masterful man, resourceful, courageous, broad\\n  of view. He fired the imagination of New England; but, being\\n  oblique of vision, merely distorted its judgment and silenced its\\n  conscience. For a while he trampled with impunity on laws human and\\n  divine; but, as he was obsessed with the delusion that two and two\\n  make five, he fell, at last, a victim to the relentless rules of\\n  humble arithmetic.\\n\\n  “‘Remember, O Stranger, Arithmetic is the first of the sciences and\\n  the mother of safety.’”\\n\\nThe exposure of the bad financial management of the New Haven railroad,\\nmore than any other one thing, led to the exposure and comprehension\\nof the wasteful methods of big business all over the country and\\nthat exposure of the New Haven was the almost single-handed work of\\nMr. Brandeis. He is a person who fights against any odds while it is\\nnecessary to fight and stops fighting as soon as the fight is won. For\\na long time very respectable and honest leaders of finance said that\\nhis charges against the New Haven were unsound and inexcusable. He\\nkept ahead. A year before the actual crash came, however, he ceased\\nworrying, for he knew the work had been carried far enough to complete\\nitself. When someone asked him to take part in some little controversy\\nshortly before the collapse, he replied, “That fight does not need me\\nany longer. Time and arithmetic will do the rest.”\\n\\nThis grasp of the concrete is combined in Mr. Brandeis with an equally\\ndistinguished grasp of bearing and significance. His imagination is\\nas notable as his understanding of business. In those accomplishments\\nwhich have given him his place in American life, the two sides of his\\nmind have worked together. The arrangement between the Gas Company\\nand the City of Boston rests on one of the guiding principles of Mr.\\nBrandeis’s life, that no contract is good that is not advantageous\\nto both parties to it. Behind his understanding of the methods of\\nobtaining insurance and the proper cost of it to the laboring man lay\\na philosophy of the vast advantage to the fibre and energy of the\\ncommunity that would come from devising methods by which the laboring\\nclasses could make themselves comfortable through their whole lives\\nand thus perhaps making unnecessary elaborate systems of state help.\\nThe most important ideas put forth in the Armstrong Committee Report\\non insurance had been previously suggested by Mr. Brandeis, acting\\nas counsel for the Equitable policy holders. Business and the more\\nimportant statesmanship were intimately combined in the management of\\nthe Protocol in New York, which has done so much to improve conditions\\nin the clothing industry. The welfare of the laborer and his relation\\nto his employer seems to Mr. Brandeis, as it does to all the most\\ncompetent thinkers today, to constitute the most important question we\\nhave to solve, and he won the case, coming up to the Supreme Court of\\nthe United States, from Oregon, establishing the constitutionality of\\nspecial protective legislation for women. In the Minimum Wage case,\\nalso from the State of Oregon, which is about to be heard before the\\nSupreme Court, he takes up what is really a logical sequence of the\\nlimitation of women’s hours in certain industries, since it would be\\na futile performance to limit their hours and then allow their wages\\nto be cut down in consequence. These industrial activities are in\\nlarge part an expression of his deep and ever growing sympathy with\\nthe working people and understanding of them. Florence Kelley once\\nsaid: “No man since Lincoln has understood the common people as Louis\\nBrandeis does.”\\n\\nWhile the majority of Mr. Brandeis’s great progressive achievements\\nhave been connected with the industrial system, some have been\\npolitical in a more limited sense. I worked with him through the\\nBallinger-Pinchot controversy, and I never saw a grasp of detail more\\nbrilliantly combined with high constructive ethical and political\\nthinking. After the man who knew most about the details of the Interior\\nDepartment had been cross-examined by Mr. Brandeis he came and sat\\ndown by me and said: “Mr. Hapgood, I have no respect for you. I do\\nnot think your motives in this agitation are good motives, but I want\\nto say that you have a wonderful lawyer. He knows as much about the\\nInterior Department today as I do.” In that controversy, the power of\\nthe administration and of the ruling forces in the House and Senate\\nwere combined to protect Secretary Ballinger and prevent the truth\\nfrom coming to light. Mr. Brandeis, in leading the fight for the\\nconservation side, was constantly haunted by the idea that there was a\\nmystery somewhere. The editorial printed above hints at how he solved\\nthe mystery, but it would require much more space to tell the other\\nsides, the enthusiasm for conservation, the convincing arguments for\\nhigher standards in office, the connection of this conspiracy with the\\ncountry’s larger needs. Seldom is an audience at a hearing so moved as\\nit was by Mr. Brandeis’s final plea to the committee.\\n\\nPossibly his work on railroads will turn out to be the most significant\\namong the many things Mr. Brandeis has done. His arguments in 1910–11\\nbefore the Interstate Commerce Commission against the raising of rates,\\non the ground that the way for railroads to be more prosperous was to\\nbe more efficient, made efficiency a national idea. It is a cardinal\\npoint in his philosophy that the only real progress toward a higher\\nnational life will come through efficiency in all our activities. The\\nseventy-eight questions addressed to the railroads by the Interstate\\nCommerce Commission in December, 1913, embody what is probably the most\\ncomprehensive embodiment of his thought on the subject.\\n\\nOn nothing has he ever worked harder than on his diagnosis of the\\nMoney Trust, and when his life comes to be written (I hope many years\\nhence) this will be ranked with his railroad work for its effect in\\naccelerating industrial changes. It is indeed more than a coincidence\\nthat so many of the things he has been contending for have come to\\npass. It is seldom that one man puts one idea, not to say many ideas,\\neffectively before the world, but it is no exaggeration to say that\\nMr. Brandeis is responsible for the now widespread recognition of\\nthe inherent weakness of great size. He was the first person who set\\nforth effectively the doctrine that there is a limit to the size of\\ngreatest efficiency, and the successful demonstration of that truth is\\na profound contribution to the subject of trusts. The demonstration\\nis powerfully put in his testimony before the Senate Committee in\\n1911, and it is powerfully put in this volume. In destroying the\\ndelusion that efficiency was a common incident of size, he emphasized\\nthe possibility of efficiency through intensive development of the\\nindividual, thus connecting this principle with his whole study of\\nefficiency, and pointing the way to industrial democracy.\\n\\nNot less notable than the intellect and the constructive ability that\\nhave gone into Mr. Brandeis’s work are the exceptional moral qualities.\\nAny powerful and entirely sincere crusader must sacrifice much. Mr.\\nBrandeis has sacrificed much in money, in agreeableness of social life,\\nin effort, and he has done it for principle and for human happiness.\\nHis power of intensive work, his sustained interest and will, and his\\ncourage have been necessary for leadership. No man could have done what\\nhe has done without being willing to devote his life to making his\\ndreams come true.\\n\\nNor should anyone make the mistake, because the labors of Mr. Brandeis\\nand others have recently brought about changes, that the system which\\nwas being attacked has been undermined. The currency bill has been\\npassed, and as these words are written, it looks as if a group of\\ntrust bills would be passed. But systems are not ended in a day. Of\\nthe truths which are embodied in the essays printed in this book, some\\nare being carried out now, but it will be many, many years before the\\nwhole idea can be made effective; and there will, therefore, be many,\\nmany years during which active citizens will be struggling for those\\nprinciples which are here so clearly, so eloquently, so conclusively\\nset forth.\\n\\nThe articles reprinted here were all written before November, 1913.\\n“The Failure of Banker Management” appeared in Harper’s Weekly Aug. 16,\\n1913; the other articles, between Nov. 22, 1913 and Dec. 17, 1914.\\n\\n  NORMAN HAPGOOD.\\n\\n  _March, 1914._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n\\n  CHAPTER      PAGE\\n\\n  I OUR FINANCIAL OLIGARCHY      1\\n\\n  II HOW THE COMBINERS COMBINE      28\\n\\n  III INTERLOCKING DIRECTORATES      51\\n\\n  IV SERVE ONE MASTER ONLY!      69\\n\\n  V WHAT PUBLICITY CAN DO      92\\n\\n  VI WHERE THE BANKER IS SUPERFLUOUS      109\\n\\n  VII BIG MEN AND LITTLE BUSINESS      135\\n\\n  VIII A CURSE OF BIGNESS      162\\n\\n  IX THE FAILURE OF BANKER-MANAGEMENT      189\\n\\n  X THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE OLIGARCHS      201\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY\\n\\nAND HOW THE BANKERS USE IT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nOUR FINANCIAL OLIGARCHY\\n\\n\\nPresident Wilson, when Governor, declared in 1911:\\n\\n“The great monopoly in this country is the money monopoly. So long\\nas that exists, our old variety and freedom and individual energy\\nof development are out of the question. A great industrial nation\\nis controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is\\nconcentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our\\nactivities are in the hands of a few men, who, even if their actions\\nbe honest and intended for the public interest, are necessarily\\nconcentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money\\nis involved and who, necessarily, by every reason of their own\\nlimitations, chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom. This\\nis the greatest question of all; and to this, statesmen must address\\nthemselves with an earnest determination to serve the long future and\\nthe true liberties of men.”\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee--appointed in 1912--found:\\n\\n  “Far more dangerous than all that has happened to us in the past in\\n  the way of elimination of competition in industry is the control of\\n  credit through the domination of these groups over our banks and\\n  industries.”...\\n\\n  “Whether under a different currency system the resources in our\\n  banks would be greater or less is comparatively immaterial if they\\n  continue to be controlled by a small group.”...\\n\\n  “It is impossible that there should be competition with all the\\n  facilities for raising money or selling large issues of bonds in\\n  the hands of these few bankers and their partners and allies, who\\n  together dominate the financial policies of most of the existing\\n  systems.... The acts of this inner group, as here described, have\\n  nevertheless been more destructive of competition than anything\\n  accomplished by the trusts, for they strike at the very vitals\\n  of potential competition in every industry that is under their\\n  protection, a condition which if permitted to continue, will\\n  render impossible all attempts to restore normal competitive\\n  conditions in the industrial world....\\n\\n  “If the arteries of credit now clogged well-nigh to choking by the\\n  obstructions created through the control of these groups are opened\\n  so that they may be permitted freely to play their important part\\n  in the financial system, competition in large enterprises will\\n  become possible and business can be conducted on its merits instead\\n  of being subject to the tribute and the good will of this handful\\n  of self-constituted trustees of the national prosperity.”\\n\\nThe promise of New Freedom was joyously proclaimed in 1913.\\n\\nThe facts which the Pujo Investigating Committee and its able Counsel,\\nMr. Samuel Untermyer, have laid before the country, show clearly the\\nmeans by which a few men control the business of America. The report\\nproposes measures which promise some relief. Additional remedies will\\nbe proposed. Congress will soon be called upon to act.\\n\\nHow shall the emancipation be wrought? On what lines shall we proceed?\\nThe facts, when fully understood, will teach us.\\n\\n\\nTHE DOMINANT ELEMENT\\n\\nThe dominant element in our financial oligarchy is the investment\\nbanker. Associated banks, trust companies and life insurance companies\\nare his tools. Controlled railroads, public service and industrial\\ncorporations are his subjects. Though properly but middlemen, these\\nbankers bestride as masters America’s business world, so that\\npractically no large enterprise can be undertaken successfully without\\ntheir participation or approval. These bankers are, of course, able\\nmen possessed of large fortunes; but the most potent factor in their\\ncontrol of business is not the possession of extraordinary ability\\nor huge wealth. The key to their power is Combination--concentration\\nintensive and comprehensive--advancing on three distinct lines:\\n\\n_First:_ There is the obvious consolidation of banks and trust\\ncompanies; the less obvious affiliations--through stockholdings, voting\\ntrusts and interlocking directorates--of banking institutions which\\nare not legally connected; and the joint transactions, gentlemen’s\\nagreements, and “banking ethics” which eliminate competition among the\\ninvestment bankers.\\n\\n_Second:_ There is the consolidation of railroads into huge systems,\\nthe large combinations of public service corporations and the\\nformation of industrial trusts, which, by making businesses so “big”\\nthat local, independent banking concerns cannot alone supply the\\nnecessary funds, has created dependence upon the associated New York\\nbankers.\\n\\nBut combination, however intensive, along these lines only, could\\nnot have produced the Money Trust--another and more potent factor of\\ncombination was added.\\n\\n_Third:_ Investment bankers, like J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., dealers in bonds,\\nstocks and notes, encroached upon the functions of the three other\\nclasses of corporations with which their business brought them into\\ncontact. They became the directing power in railroads, public service\\nand industrial companies through which our great business operations\\nare conducted--the makers of bonds and stocks. They became the\\ndirecting power in the life insurance companies, and other corporate\\nreservoirs of the people’s savings--the buyers of bonds and stocks.\\nThey became the directing power also in banks and trust companies--the\\ndepositaries of the quick capital of the country--the life blood of\\nbusiness, with which they and others carried on their operations.\\nThus four distinct functions, each essential to business, and each\\nexercised, originally, by a distinct set of men, became united in the\\ninvestment banker. It is to this union of business functions that the\\nexistence of the Money Trust is mainly due.*\\n\\n  * Obviously only a few of the investment bankers exercise this\\n    great power; but many others perform important functions in the\\n    system, as hereinafter described.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe development of our financial oligarchy followed, in this respect,\\nlines with which the history of political despotism has familiarized\\nus:--usurpation, proceeding by gradual encroachment rather than by\\nviolent acts; subtle and often long-concealed concentration of distinct\\nfunctions, which are beneficent when separately administered, and\\ndangerous only when combined in the same persons. It was by processes\\nsuch as these that Cæsar Augustus became master of Rome. The makers of\\nour own Constitution had in mind like dangers to our political liberty\\nwhen they provided so carefully for the separation of governmental\\npowers.\\n\\n\\nTHE PROPER SPHERE OF THE INVESTMENT BANKER\\n\\nThe original function of the investment banker was that of dealer in\\nbonds, stocks and notes; buying mainly at wholesale from corporations,\\nmunicipalities, states and governments which need money, and selling\\nto those seeking investments. The banker performs, in this respect,\\nthe function of a merchant; and the function is a very useful one.\\nLarge business enterprises are conducted generally by corporations.\\nThe permanent capital of corporations is represented by bonds and\\nstocks. The bonds and stocks of the more important corporations are\\nowned, in large part, by small investors, who do not participate in\\nthe management of the company. Corporations require the aid of a\\nbanker-middleman, for they lack generally the reputation and clientele\\nessential to selling their own bonds and stocks direct to the investor.\\nInvestors in corporate securities, also, require the services of a\\nbanker-middleman. The number of securities upon the market is very\\nlarge. Only a part of these securities is listed on the New York\\nStock Exchange; but its listings alone comprise about sixteen hundred\\ndifferent issues aggregating about $26,500,000,000, and each year new\\nlistings are made averaging about two hundred and thirty-three to an\\namount of $1,500,000,000. For a small investor to make an intelligent\\nselection from these many corporate securities--indeed, to pass an\\nintelligent judgment upon a single one--is ordinarily impossible. He\\nlacks the ability, the facilities, the training and the time essential\\nto a proper investigation. Unless his purchase is to be little better\\nthan a gamble, he needs the advice of an expert, who, combining special\\nknowledge with judgment, has the facilities and incentive to make a\\nthorough investigation. This dependence, both of corporations and of\\ninvestors, upon the banker has grown in recent years, since women and\\nothers who do not participate in the management, have become the owners\\nof so large a part of the stocks and bonds of our great corporations.\\nOver half of the stockholders of the American Sugar Refining Company\\nand nearly half of the stockholders of the Pennsylvania Railroad and of\\nthe New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad are women.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nGood-will--the possession by a dealer of numerous and valuable regular\\ncustomers--is always an important element in merchandising. But in\\nthe business of selling bonds and stocks, it is of exceptional value,\\nfor the very reason that the small investor relies so largely upon\\nthe banker’s judgment. This confidential relation of the banker to\\ncustomers--and the knowledge of the customers’ private affairs acquired\\nincidentally--is often a determining factor in the marketing of\\nsecurities. With the advent of Big Business such good-will possessed\\nby the older banking houses, preëminently J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. and their\\nPhiladelphia House called Drexel & Co., by Lee, Higginson & Co. and\\nKidder, Peabody, & Co. of Boston, and by Kuhn, Loeb & Co. of New York,\\nbecame of enhanced importance. The volume of new security issues was\\ngreatly increased by huge railroad consolidations, the development of\\nthe holding companies, and particularly by the formation of industrial\\ntrusts. The rapidly accumulating savings of our people sought\\ninvestment. The field of operations for the dealer in securities was\\nthus much enlarged. And, as the securities were new and untried, the\\nservices of the investment banker were in great demand, and his powers\\nand profits increased accordingly.\\n\\n\\nCONTROLLING THE SECURITY MAKERS\\n\\nBut this enlargement of their legitimate field of operations did not\\nsatisfy investment bankers. They were not content merely to deal\\nin securities. They desired to manufacture them also. They became\\npromoters, or allied themselves with promoters. Thus it was that\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Company formed the Steel Trust, the Harvester Trust\\nand the Shipping Trust. And, adding the duties of undertaker to those\\nof midwife, the investment bankers became, in times of corporate\\ndisaster, members of security-holders’ “Protective Committees”; then\\nthey participated as “Reorganization Managers” in the reincarnation of\\nthe unsuccessful corporations and ultimately became directors. It was\\nin this way that the Morgan associates acquired their hold upon the\\nSouthern Railway, the Northern Pacific, the Reading, the Erie, the Père\\nMarquette, the Chicago and Great Western, and the Cincinnati, Hamilton\\n& Dayton. Often they insured the continuance of such control by the\\ndevice of the voting trust; but even where no voting trust was created,\\na secure hold was acquired upon reorganization. It was in this way also\\nthat Kuhn, Loeb & Co. became potent in the Union Pacific and in the\\nBaltimore & Ohio.\\n\\nBut the banker’s participation in the management of corporations was\\nnot limited to cases of promotion or reorganization. An urgent or\\nextensive need of new money was considered a sufficient reason for the\\nbanker’s entering a board of directors. Often without even such excuse\\nthe investment banker has secured a place upon the Board of Directors,\\nthrough his powerful influence or the control of his customers’\\nproxies. Such seems to have been the fatal entrance of Mr. Morgan into\\nthe management of the then prosperous New York, New Haven & Hartford\\nRailroad, in 1892. When once a banker has entered the Board--whatever\\nmay have been the occasion--his grip proves tenacious and his influence\\nusually supreme; for he controls the supply of new money.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe investment banker is naturally on the lookout for good bargains\\nin bonds and stocks. Like other merchants, he wants to buy his\\nmerchandise cheap. But when he becomes director of a corporation,\\nhe occupies a position which prevents the transaction by which he\\nacquires its corporate securities from being properly called a bargain.\\nCan there be real bargaining where the same man is on both sides of\\na trade? The investment banker, through his controlling influence\\non the Board of Directors, decides that the corporation shall issue\\nand sell the securities, decides the price at which it shall sell\\nthem, and decides that it shall sell the securities to himself. The\\nfact that there are other directors besides the banker on the Board\\ndoes not, in practice, prevent this being the result. The banker,\\nwho holds the purse-strings, becomes usually the dominant spirit.\\nThrough voting-trusteeships, exclusive financial agencies, membership\\non executive or finance committees, or by mere directorships, J.\\xa0P.\\nMorgan & Co., and their associates, held such financial power in at\\nleast thirty-two transportation systems, public utility corporations\\nand industrial companies--companies with an aggregate capitalization of\\n$17,273,000,000. Mainly for corporations so controlled, J.\\xa0P. Morgan\\n& Co. procured the public marketing in ten years of security issues\\naggregating $1,950,000,000. This huge sum does not include any issues\\nmarketed privately, nor any issues, however marketed, of intra-state\\ncorporations. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and a few other investment bankers\\nexercise similar control over many other corporations.\\n\\n\\nCONTROLLING SECURITY BUYERS\\n\\nSuch control of railroads, public service and industrial corporations\\nassures to the investment bankers an ample supply of securities at\\nattractive prices; and merchandise well bought is half sold. But these\\nbond and stock merchants are not disposed to take even a slight risk as\\nto their ability to market their goods. They saw that if they could\\ncontrol the security-buyers, as well as the security-makers, investment\\nbanking would, indeed, be “a happy hunting ground”; and they have made\\nit so.\\n\\nThe numerous small investors cannot, in the strict sense, be\\ncontrolled; but their dependence upon the banker insures their being\\nduly influenced. A large part, however, of all bonds issued and of\\nmany stocks are bought by the prominent corporate investors; and\\nmost prominent among these are the life insurance companies, the\\ntrust companies, and the banks. The purchase of a security by these\\ninstitutions not only relieves the banker of the merchandise, but\\nrecommends it strongly to the small investor, who believes that these\\ninstitutions are wisely managed. These controlled corporate investors\\nare not only large customers, but may be particularly accommodating\\nones. Individual investors are moody. They buy only when they want\\nto do so. They are sometimes inconveniently reluctant. Corporate\\ninvestors, if controlled, may be made to buy when the bankers need a\\nmarket. It was natural that the investment bankers proceeded to get\\ncontrol of the great life insurance companies, as well as of the trust\\ncompanies and the banks.\\n\\nThe field thus occupied is uncommonly rich. The life insurance\\ncompanies are our leading institutions for savings. Their huge surplus\\nand reserves, augmented daily, are always clamoring for investment.\\nNo panic or money shortage stops the inflow of new money from the\\nperennial stream of premiums on existing policies and interest on\\nexisting investments. The three great companies--the New York Life, the\\nMutual of New York, and the Equitable--would have over $55,000,000 of\\n_new_ money to invest annually, even if they did not issue a single new\\npolicy. In 1904--just before the Armstrong investigation--these three\\ncompanies had together $1,247,331,738.18 of assets. They had issued\\nin that year $1,025,671,126 of new policies. The New York legislature\\nplaced in 1906 certain restrictions upon their growth; so that their\\nnew business since has averaged $547,384,212, or only fifty-three\\nper cent. of what it was in 1904. But the aggregate assets of these\\ncompanies increased in the last eight years to $1,817,052,260.36. At\\nthe time of the Armstrong investigation the average age of these three\\ncompanies was fifty-six years. _The growth of assets in the last eight\\nyears was about half as large as the total growth in the preceding\\nfifty-six years._ These three companies must invest annually about\\n$70,000,000 of new money; and besides, many old investments expire\\nor are changed and the proceeds must be reinvested. A large part of\\nall life insurance surplus and reserves are invested in bonds. The\\naggregate bond investments of these three companies on January 1, 1913,\\nwas $1,019,153,268.93.\\n\\nIt was natural that the investment bankers should seek to control\\nthese never-failing reservoirs of capital. George W. Perkins was\\nVice-President of the New York Life, the largest of the companies.\\nWhile remaining such he was made a partner in J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., and\\nin the four years preceding the Armstrong investigation, his firm sold\\nthe New York Life $38,804,918.51 in securities. The New York Life is a\\nmutual company, supposed to be controlled by its policy-holders. But,\\nas the Pujo Committee funds “the so-called control of life insurance\\ncompanies by policy-holders through mutualization is a farce” and “its\\nonly result is to keep in office a self-constituted, self-perpetuating\\nmanagement.”\\n\\nThe Equitable Life Assurance Society is a stock company and is\\ncontrolled by $100,000 of stock. The dividend on this stock is\\nlimited by law to seven per cent.; but in 1910 Mr. Morgan paid about\\n$3,000,000 for $51,000, par value of this stock, or $5,882.35 a share.\\nThe dividend return on the stock investment is less than one-eighth\\nof one per cent.; but the assets controlled amount now to over\\n$500,000,000. And certain of these assets had an especial value for\\ninvestment bankers;--namely, the large holdings of stock in banks and\\ntrust companies.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe Armstrong investigation disclosed the extent of financial power\\nexerted through the insurance company holdings of bank and trust\\ncompany stock. The Committee recommended legislation compelling the\\ninsurance companies to dispose of the stock within five years. A law to\\nthat effect was enacted, but the time was later extended. The companies\\nthen disposed of a part of their bank and trust company stocks; but,\\nas the insurance companies were controlled by the investment bankers,\\nthese gentlemen sold the bank and trust company stocks to themselves.\\n\\nReferring to such purchases from the Mutual Life, as well as from the\\nEquitable, the Pujo Committee found:\\n\\n“Here, then, were stocks of five important trust companies and one of\\nour largest national banks in New York City that had been held by\\nthese two life insurance companies. Within five years all of these\\nstocks, so far as distributed by the insurance companies, have found\\ntheir way into the hands of the men who virtually controlled or were\\nidentified with the management of the insurance companies or of their\\nclose allies and associates, to that extent thus further entrenching\\nthem.”\\n\\nThe banks and trust companies are depositaries, in the main, not of the\\npeople’s savings, but of the business man’s quick capital. Yet, since\\nthe investment banker acquired control of banks and trust companies,\\nthese institutions also have become, like the life companies, large\\npurchasers of bonds and stocks. Many of our national banks have\\ninvested in this manner a large part of all their resources, including\\ncapital, surplus and deposits. The bond investments of some banks\\nexceed by far the aggregate of their capital and surplus, and nearly\\nequal their loanable deposits.\\n\\n\\nCONTROLLING OTHER PEOPLE’S QUICK CAPITAL\\n\\nThe goose that lays golden eggs has been considered a most valuable\\npossession. But even more profitable is the privilege of taking the\\ngolden eggs laid by somebody else’s goose. The investment bankers and\\ntheir associates now enjoy that privilege. They control the people\\nthrough the people’s own money. If the bankers’ power were commensurate\\nonly with their wealth, they would have relatively little influence on\\nAmerican business. Vast fortunes like those of the Astors are no doubt\\nregrettable. They are inconsistent with democracy. They are unsocial.\\nAnd they seem peculiarly unjust when they represent largely unearned\\nincrement. But the wealth of the Astors does not endanger political\\nor industrial liberty. It is insignificant in amount as compared\\nwith the aggregate wealth of America, or even of New York City. It\\nlacks significance largely because its owners have only the income\\nfrom their own wealth. The Astor wealth is static. The wealth of the\\nMorgan associates is dynamic. The power and the growth of power of our\\nfinancial oligarchs comes from wielding the savings and quick capital\\nof others. In two of the three great life insurance companies the\\ninfluence of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. and their associates is exerted without\\nany individual investment by them whatsoever. Even in the Equitable,\\nwhere Mr. Morgan bought an actual majority of all the outstanding\\nstock, his investment amounts to little more than one-half of one per\\ncent. of the assets of the company. The fetters which bind the people\\nare forged from the people’s own gold.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBut the reservoir of other people’s money, from which the investment\\nbankers now draw their greatest power, is not the life insurance\\ncompanies, but the banks and the trust companies. Bank deposits\\nrepresent the really quick capital of the nation. They are the life\\nblood of businesses. Their effective force is much greater than that\\nof an equal amount of wealth permanently invested. The 34 banks and\\ntrust companies, which the Pujo Committee declared to be directly\\ncontrolled by the Morgan associates, held $1,983,000,000 in deposits.\\nControl of these institutions means the ability to lend a large part\\nof these funds, directly and indirectly, to themselves; and what is\\noften even more important, the power to prevent the funds being lent\\nto any rival interests. These huge deposits can, in the discretion of\\nthose in control, be used to meet the temporary needs of their subject\\ncorporations. When bonds and stocks are issued to finance permanently\\nthese corporations, the bank deposits can, in large part, be loaned by\\nthe investment bankers in control to themselves and their associates;\\nso that securities bought may be carried by them, until sold to\\ninvestors. Or these bank deposits may be loaned to allied bankers,\\nor jobbers in securities, or to speculators, to enable them to carry\\nthe bonds or stocks. Easy money tends to make securities rise in the\\nmarket. Tight money nearly always makes them fall. The control by the\\nleading investment bankers over the banks and trust companies is so\\ngreat, that they can often determine, for a time, the market for money\\nby lending or refusing to lend on the Stock Exchange. In this way,\\namong others, they have power to affect the general trend of prices\\nin bonds and stocks. Their power over a particular security is even\\ngreater. Its sale on the market may depend upon whether the security is\\nfavored or discriminated against when offered to the banks and trust\\ncompanies, as collateral for loans.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is the investment banker’s access to other people’s\\nmoney in controlled banks and trust companies which alone enables\\nany individual banking concern to take so large part of the annual\\noutput of bonds and stocks. The banker’s own capital, however large,\\nwould soon be exhausted. And even the loanable funds of the banks\\nwould often be exhausted, but for the large deposits made in those\\nbanks by the life insurance, railroad, public service, and industrial\\ncorporations which the bankers also control. On December 31, 1912, the\\nthree leading life insurance companies had deposits in banks and trust\\ncompanies aggregating $13,839,189.08. As the Pujo Committee finds:\\n\\n“The men who through their control over the funds of our railroads and\\nindustrial companies are able to direct where such funds shall be kept\\nand thus to create these great reservoirs of the people’s money, are\\nthe ones who are in position to tap those reservoirs for the ventures\\nin which they are interested and to prevent their being tapped for\\npurposes of which they do not approve. The latter is quite as important\\na factor as the former. It is the controlling consideration in its\\neffect on competition in the railroad and industrial world.”\\n\\n\\nHAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO\\n\\nBut the power of the investment banker over other people’s money is\\noften more direct and effective than that exerted through controlled\\nbanks and trust companies. J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. achieve the supposedly\\nimpossible feat of having their cake and eating it too. They buy the\\nbonds and stocks of controlled railroads and industrial concerns, and\\npay the purchase price; and still do not part with their money. This\\nis accomplished by the simple device of becoming the bank of deposit\\nof the controlled corporations, instead of having the company deposit\\nin some merely controlled bank in whose operation others have at least\\nsome share. When J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. buy an issue of securities the\\npurchase money, instead of being paid over to the corporation, is\\nretained by the banker for the corporation, to be drawn upon only as\\nthe funds are needed by the corporation. And as the securities are\\nissued in large blocks, and the money raised is often not all spent\\nuntil long thereafter, the aggregate of the balances remaining in the\\nbanker’s hands are huge. Thus J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. (including their\\nPhiladelphia house, called Drexel & Co.) held on November 1, 1912,\\ndeposits aggregating $162,491,819.65.\\n\\n\\nPOWER AND PELF\\n\\nThe operations of so comprehensive a system of concentration\\nnecessarily developed in the bankers overweening power. And the\\nbankers’ power grows by what it feeds on. Power begets wealth; and\\nadded wealth opens ever new opportunities for the acquisition of wealth\\nand power. The operations of these bankers are so vast and numerous\\nthat even a very reasonable compensation for the service performed by\\nthe bankers, would, in the aggregate, produce for them incomes so large\\nas to result in huge accumulations of capital. But the compensation\\ntaken by the bankers as commissions or profits is often far from\\nreasonable. Occupying, as they so frequently do, the inconsistent\\nposition of being at the same time seller and buyer, the standard for\\nso-called compensation actually applied, is not the “Rule of reason”,\\nbut “All the traffic will bear.” And this is true even where there is\\nno sinister motive. The weakness of human nature prevents men from\\nbeing good judges of their own deservings.\\n\\nThe syndicate formed by J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. to underwrite the United\\nStates Steel Corporation took for its services securities which netted\\n$62,500,000 in cash. Of this huge sum J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. received, as\\nsyndicate managers, $12,500,000 in addition to the share which they\\nwere entitled to receive as syndicate members. This sum of $62,500,000\\nwas only a part of the fees paid for the service of monopolizing the\\nsteel industry. In addition to the commissions taken specifically\\nfor organizing the United States Steel Corporation, large sums were\\npaid for organizing the several companies of which it is composed. For\\ninstance, the National Tube Company was capitalized at $80,000,000 of\\nstock; $40,000,000 of which was common stock. Half of this $40,000,000\\nwas taken by J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. and their associates for promotion\\nservices; and the $20,000,000 stock so taken became later exchangeable\\nfor $25,000,000 of Steel Common. Commissioner of Corporations Herbert\\nKnox Smith, found that:\\n\\n“More than $150,000,000 of the stock of the Steel Corporation was\\nissued directly or indirectly (through exchange) for mere promotion or\\nunderwriting services. In other words, nearly one-seventh of the total\\ncapital stock of the Steel Corporation appears to have been issued\\ndirectly or indirectly to promoters’ services.”\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe so-called fees and commissions taken by the bankers and associates\\nupon the organization of the trusts have been exceptionally large. But\\neven after the trusts are successfully launched the exactions of the\\nbankers are often extortionate. The syndicate which underwrote, in\\n1901, the Steel Corporation’s preferred stock conversion plan, advanced\\nonly $20,000,000 in cash and received an underwriting commission of\\n$6,800,000.\\n\\nThe exaction of huge commissions is not confined to trust and other\\nindustrial concerns. The Interborough Railway is a most prosperous\\ncorporation. It earned last year nearly 21 per cent. on its capital\\nstock, and secured from New York City, in connection with the subway\\nextension, a very favorable contract. But when it financed its\\n$170,000,000 bond issue it was agreed that J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. should\\nreceive three per cent., that is, $5,100,000, for merely forming this\\nsyndicate. More recently, the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad\\nagreed to pay J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. a commission of $1,680,000; that is,\\n2 1/2 per cent., to form a syndicate to underwrite an issue at par of\\n$67,000,000 20-year 6 per cent. convertible debentures. That means: The\\nbankers bound themselves to take at 97 1/2 any of these six per cent.\\nconvertible bonds which stockholders might be unwilling to buy at 100.\\nWhen the contract was made the New Haven’s then outstanding six per\\ncent. convertible bonds were selling at 114. And the new issue, as\\nsoon as announced, was in such demand that the public offered and was\\nfor months willing to buy at 106 bonds which the Company were to pay\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. $1,680,000 to be willing to take at par.\\n\\n\\nWHY THE BANKS BECAME INVESTMENT BANKERS\\n\\nThese large profits from promotions, underwritings and security\\npurchases led to a revolutionary change in the conduct of our leading\\nbanking institutions. It was obvious that control by the investment\\nbankers of the deposits in banks and trust companies was an essential\\nelement in their securing these huge profits. And the bank officers\\nnaturally asked, “Why then should not the banks and trust companies\\nshare in so profitable a field? Why should not they themselves become\\ninvestment bankers too, with all the new functions incident to ‘Big\\nBusiness’?” To do so would involve a departure from the legitimate\\nsphere of the banking business, which is the making of temporary\\nloans to business concerns. But the temptation was irresistible. The\\ninvasion of the investment banker into the banks’ field of operation\\nwas followed by a counter invasion by the banks into the realm of the\\ninvestment banker. Most prominent among the banks were the National\\nCity and the First National of New York. But theirs was not a hostile\\ninvasion. The contending forces met as allies, joined forces to control\\nthe business of the country, and to “divide the spoils.” The alliance\\nwas cemented by voting trusts, by interlocking directorates and by\\njoint ownerships. There resulted the fullest “coöperation”; and ever\\nmore railroads, public service corporations, and industrial concerns\\nwere brought into complete subjection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nHOW THE COMBINERS COMBINE\\n\\n\\nAmong the allies, two New York banks--the National City and the First\\nNational--stand preëminent. They constitute, with the Morgan firm,\\nthe inner group of the Money Trust. Each of the two banks, like J.\\xa0P.\\nMorgan & Co., has huge resources. Each of the two banks, like the firm\\nof J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., has been dominated by a genius in combination.\\nIn the National City it is James Stillman; in the First National,\\nGeorge F. Baker. Each of these gentlemen was formerly President,\\nand is now Chairman of the Board of Directors. The resources of the\\nNational City Bank (including its Siamese-twin security company) are\\nabout $300,000,000; those of the First National Bank (including its\\nSiamese-twin security company) are about $200,000,000. The resources\\nof the Morgan firm have not been disclosed. But it appears that they\\nhave available for their operations, also, huge deposits from their\\nsubjects; deposits reported as $162,500,000.\\n\\nThe private fortunes of the chief actors in the combination have not\\nbeen ascertained. But sporadic evidence indicates how great are the\\npossibilities of accumulation when one has the use of “other people’s\\nmoney.” Mr. Morgan’s wealth became proverbial. Of Mr. Stillman’s many\\ninvestments, only one was specifically referred to, as he was in\\nEurope during the investigation, and did not testify. But that one is\\nsignificant. His 47,498 shares in the National City Bank are worth\\nabout $18,000,000. Mr. Jacob H. Schiff aptly described this as “a very\\nnice investment.”\\n\\nOf Mr. Baker’s investments we know more, as he testified on many\\nsubjects. His 20,000 shares in the First National Bank are worth at\\nleast $20,000,000. His stocks in six other New York banks and trust\\ncompanies are together worth about $3,000,000. The scale of his\\ninvestment in railroads may be inferred from his former holdings in\\nthe Central Railroad of New Jersey. He was its largest stockholder--so\\nlarge that with a few friends he held a majority of the $27,436,800 par\\nvalue of outstanding stock, which the Reading bought at $160 a share.\\nHe is a director in 28 other railroad companies; and presumably a\\nstockholder in, at least, as many. The full extent of his fortune was\\nnot inquired into, for that was not an issue in the investigation. But\\nit is not surprising that Mr. Baker saw little need of new laws. When\\nasked:\\n\\n“You think everything is all right as it is in this world, do you not?”\\n\\nHe answered:\\n\\n“Pretty nearly.”\\n\\n\\nRAMIFICATIONS OF POWER\\n\\nBut wealth expressed in figures gives a wholly inadequate picture of\\nthe allies’ power. Their wealth is dynamic. It is wielded by geniuses\\nin combination. It finds its proper expression in means of control.\\nTo comprehend the power of the allies we must try to visualize the\\nramifications through which the forces operate.\\n\\nMr. Baker is a director in 22 corporations having, with their many\\nsubsidiaries, aggregate resources or capitalization of $7,272,000,000.\\nBut the direct and visible power of the First National Bank, which\\nMr. Baker dominates, extends further. The Pujo report shows that its\\ndirectors (including Mr. Baker’s son) are directors in at least 27\\nother corporations with resources of $4,270,000,000. That is, the First\\nNational is represented in 49 corporations, with aggregate resources\\nor capitalization of $11,542,000,000.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt may help to an appreciation of the allies’ power to name a few of\\nthe more prominent corporations in which, for instance, Mr. Baker’s\\ninfluence is exerted--visibly and directly--as voting trustee,\\nexecutive committee man or simple director.\\n\\n1. _Banks, Trust, and Life Insurance Companies:_ First National Bank of\\nNew York; National Bank of Commerce; Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company;\\nMutual Life Insurance Company.\\n\\n2. _Railroad Companies:_ New York Central Lines; New Haven, Reading,\\nErie, Lackawanna, Lehigh Valley, Southern, Northern Pacific, Chicago,\\nBurlington & Quincy.\\n\\n3. _Public Service Corporations:_ American Telegraph & Telephone\\nCompany, Adams Express Company.\\n\\n4. _Industrial Corporations:_ United States Steel Corporation, Pullman\\nCompany.\\n\\nMr. Stillman is a director in only 7 corporations, with aggregate\\nassets of $2,476,000,000; but the directors in the National City Bank,\\nwhich he dominates, are directors in at least 41 other corporations\\nwhich, with their subsidiaries, have an aggregate capitalization\\nor resources of $10,564,000,000. The members of the firm of J.\\xa0P.\\nMorgan & Co., the acknowledged leader of the allied forces, hold 72\\ndirectorships in 47 of the largest corporations of the country.\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee finds that the members of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. and the\\ndirectors of their controlled trust companies and of the First National\\nand the National City Bank together hold:\\n\\n“One hundred and eighteen directorships in 34 banks and trust companies\\nhaving total resources of $2,679,000,000 and total deposits of\\n$1,983,000,000.\\n\\n“Thirty directorships in 10 insurance companies having total assets of\\n$2,293,000,000.\\n\\n“One hundred and five directorships in 32 transportation systems\\nhaving a total capitalization of $11,784,000,000 and a total mileage\\n(excluding express companies and steamship lines) of 150,200.\\n\\n“Sixty-three directorships in 24 producing and trading corporations\\nhaving a total capitalization of $3,339,000,000.\\n\\n“Twenty-five directorships in 12 public-utility corporations having a\\ntotal capitalization of $2,150,000,000.\\n\\n“In all, 341 directorships in 112 corporations having aggregate\\nresources or capitalization of $22,245,000,000.”\\n\\n\\nTWENTY-TWO BILLION DOLLARS\\n\\nTwenty-two billion dollars is a large sum--so large that we have\\ndifficulty in grasping its significance. The mind realizes size only\\nthrough comparisons. With what can we compare twenty-two billions of\\ndollars? Twenty-two billions of dollars is more than three times the\\nassessed value of all the property, real and personal, in all New\\nEngland. It is nearly three times the assessed value of all the real\\nestate in the City of New York. It is more than twice the assessed\\nvalue of all the property in the thirteen Southern states. It is more\\nthan the assessed value of all the property in the twenty-two states,\\nnorth and south, lying west of the Mississippi River.\\n\\nBut the huge sum of twenty-two billion dollars is not large enough to\\ninclude all the corporations to which the “influence” of the three\\nallies, directly and visibly, extends, for\\n\\n_First:_ There are 56 other corporations (not included in the Pujo\\nschedule) each with capital or resources of over $5,000,000, and\\naggregating nearly $1,350,000,000, in which the Morgan allies are\\nrepresented according to the directories of directors.\\n\\n_Second:_ The Pujo schedule does not include any corporation with\\nresources of less than $5,000,000. But these financial giants have\\nshown their humility by becoming directors in many such. For instance,\\nmembers of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., and directors in the National City\\nBank and the First National Bank are also directors in 158 such\\ncorporations. Available publications disclose the capitalization of\\nonly 38 of these, but those 38 aggregate $78,669,375.\\n\\n_Third:_ The Pujo schedule includes only the corporations in which the\\nMorgan associates actually appear by name as directors. It does not\\ninclude those in which they are represented by dummies, or otherwise.\\nFor instance, the Morgan influence certainly extends to the Kansas\\nCity Terminal Railway Company, for which they have marketed since 1910\\n(in connection with others) four issues aggregating $41,761,000. But\\nno member of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., of the National City Bank, or of the\\nFirst National Bank appears on the Kansas City Terminal directorate.\\n\\n_Fourth:_ The Pujo schedule does not include all the subsidiaries of\\nthe corporations scheduled. For instance, the capitalization of the New\\nHaven System is given as $385,000,000. That sum represents the bond and\\nstock capital of the New Haven _Railroad_. But the New Haven _System_\\ncomprises many controlled corporations whose capitalization is only\\nto a slight extent included directly or indirectly in the New Haven\\nRailroad balance sheet. The New Haven, like most large corporations,\\nis a holding company also; and a holding company may control\\nsubsidiaries while owning but a small part of the latters’ outstanding\\nsecurities. Only the small part so held will be represented in the\\nholding company’s balance sheet. Thus, while the New Haven Railroad’s\\ncapitalization is only $385,000,000--and that sum only appears in the\\nPujo schedule--the capitalization of the New Haven System, as shown by\\na chart submitted to the Committee, is over twice as great; namely,\\n$849,000,000.\\n\\nIt is clear, therefore, that the $22,000,000,000, referred to by the\\nPujo Committee, understates the extent of concentration effected by the\\ninner group of the Money Trust.\\n\\n\\nCEMENTING THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE\\n\\nCare was taken by these builders of imperial power that their structure\\nshould be enduring. It has been buttressed on every side by joint\\nownerships and mutual stockholdings, as well as by close personal\\nrelationships; for directorships are ephemeral and may end with a new\\nelection. Mr. Morgan and his partners acquired one-sixth of the stock\\nof the First National Bank, and made a $6,000,000 investment in the\\nstock of the National City Bank. Then J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., the National\\nCity, and the First National (or their dominant officers--Mr. Stillman\\nand Mr. Baker) acquired together, by stock purchases and voting trusts,\\ncontrol of the National Bank of Commerce, with its $190,000,000 of\\nresources; of the Chase National, with $125,000,000; of the Guaranty\\nTrust Company, with $232,000,000; of the Bankers’ Trust Company, with\\n$205,000,000; and of a number of smaller, but important, financial\\ninstitutions. They became joint voting trustees in great railroad\\nsystems; and finally (as if the allies were united into a single\\nconcern) loyal and efficient service in the banks--like that rendered\\nby Mr. Davison and Mr. Lamont in the First National--was rewarded by\\npromotion to membership in the firm of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.\\n\\n\\nTHE PROVINCIAL ALLIES\\n\\nThus equipped and bound together, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., the National City\\nand the First National easily dominated America’s financial center, New\\nYork; for certain other important bankers, to be hereafter mentioned,\\nwere held in restraint by “gentlemen’s” agreements. The three allies\\ndominated Philadelphia too; for the firm of Drexel & Co. is J.\\xa0P.\\nMorgan & Co. under another name. But there are two other important\\nmoney centers in America, Boston and Chicago.\\n\\nIn Boston there are two large international banking houses--Lee,\\nHigginson & Co., and Kidder, Peabody & Co.--both long established\\nand rich; and each possessing an extensive, wealthy clientele of\\neager investors in bonds and stocks. Since 1907 each of these firms\\nhas purchased or underwritten (principally in conjunction with other\\nbankers) about 100 different security issues of the greater interstate\\ncorporations, the issues of each banker amounting in the aggregate to\\nover $1,000,000,000. Concentration of banking capital has proceeded\\neven further in Boston than in New York. By successive consolidations\\nthe number of national banks has been reduced from 58 in 1898 to 19 in\\n1913. There are in Boston now also 23 trust companies.\\n\\nThe National Shawmut Bank, the First National Bank of Boston and the\\nOld Colony Trust Co., which these two Boston banking houses and their\\nassociates control, alone have aggregate resources of $288,386,294,\\nconstituting about one-half of the banking resources of the city. These\\ngreat banking institutions, which are themselves the result of many\\nconsolidations, and the 21 other banks and trust companies, in which\\ntheir directors are also directors, hold together 90 per cent. of the\\ntotal banking resources of Boston. And linked to them by interlocking\\ndirectorates are 9 other banks and trust companies whose aggregate\\nresources are about 2 1/2 per cent. of Boston’s total. Thus of 42\\nbanking institutions, 33, with aggregate resources of $560,516,239,\\nholding about 92 1/2 per cent. of the aggregate banking resources of\\nBoston, are interlocked. But even the remaining 9 banks and trust\\ncompanies, which together hold but 7 1/2 per cent. of Boston banking\\nresources, are not all independent of one another. Three are linked\\ntogether; so that there appear to be only six banks in all Boston\\nthat are free from interlocking directorate relations. They together\\nrepresent but 5 per cent. of Boston’s banking resources. And it may\\nwell be doubted whether all of even those 6 are entirely free from\\naffiliation with the other groups.\\n\\nBoston’s banking concentration is not limited to the legal confines\\nof the city. Around Boston proper are over thirty suburbs, which with\\nit form what is popularly known as “Greater Boston.” These suburban\\nmunicipalities, and also other important cities like Worcester and\\nSpringfield, are, in many respects, within Boston’s “sphere of\\ninfluence.” Boston’s inner banking group has interlocked, not only 33\\nof the 42 banks of Boston proper, as above shown, but has linked with\\nthem, by interlocking directorships, at least 42 other banks and trust\\ncompanies in 35 other municipalities.\\n\\nOnce Lee, Higginson & Co. and Kidder, Peabody & Co. were active\\ncompetitors. They are so still in some small, or purely local matters;\\nbut both are devoted co-operators with the Morgan associates in\\nlarger and interstate transactions; and the alliance with these great\\nBoston banking houses has been cemented by mutual stockholdings and\\nco-directorships. Financial concentration seems to have found its\\nhighest expression in Boston.\\n\\nSomewhat similar relations exist between the triple alliance and\\nChicago’s great financial institutions--its First National Bank, the\\nIllinois Trust and Savings Bank, and the Continental & Commercial\\nNational Bank--which together control resources of $561,000,000. And\\nsimilar relations would doubtless be found to exist with the leading\\nbankers of the other important financial centers of America, as to\\nwhich the Pujo Committee was prevented by lack of time from making\\ninvestigation.\\n\\n\\nTHE AUXILIARIES\\n\\nSuch are the primary, such the secondary powers which comprise the\\nMoney Trust; but these are supplemented by forces of magnitude.\\n\\n“Radiating from these principal groups,” says the Pujo Committee, “and\\nclosely affiliated with them are smaller but important banking houses,\\nsuch as Kissel, Kinnicut & Co., White, Weld & Co., and Harvey Fisk &\\nSons, who receive large and lucrative patronage from the dominating\\ngroups, and are used by the latter as jobbers or distributors of\\nsecurities, the issuing of which they control, but which for reasons\\nof their own they prefer not to have issued or distributed under their\\nown names. Lee, Higginson & Co., besides being partners with the inner\\ngroup, are also frequently utilized in this service because of their\\nfacilities as distributors of securities.”\\n\\nFor instance, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. as fiscal agents of the New Haven\\nRailroad had the right to market its securities and that of its\\nsubsidiaries. Among the numerous New Haven subsidiaries, is the New\\nYork, Westchester and Boston--the road which cost $1,500,000 a mile to\\nbuild, and which earned a _deficit_ last year of nearly $1,500,000,\\nbesides failing to earn any return upon the New Haven’s own stock and\\nbond investment of $8,241,951. When the New Haven concluded to market\\n$17,200,000 of these bonds, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., “for reasons of their\\nown,” “preferred not to have these bonds issued or distributed under\\ntheir own name.” The Morgan firm took the bonds at 92 1/2 net; and the\\nbonds were marketed by Kissel, Kinnicut & Co. and others at 96 1/4.\\n\\n\\nTHE SATELLITES\\n\\nThe alliance is still further supplemented, as the Pujo Committee\\nshows:\\n\\n  “Beyond these inner groups and sub-groups are banks and bankers\\n  throughout the country who co-operate with them in underwriting\\n  or guaranteeing the sale of securities offered to the public,\\n  and who also act as distributors of such securities. It was\\n  impossible to learn the identity of these corporations, owing to\\n  the unwillingness of the members of the inner group to disclose\\n  the names of their underwriters, but sufficient appears to justify\\n  the statement that there are at least hundreds of them and that\\n  they extend into many of the cities throughout this and foreign\\n  countries.\\n\\n  “The patronage thus proceeding from the inner group and its\\n  sub-groups is of great value to these banks and bankers, who\\n  are thus tied by self-interest to the great issuing houses and\\n  may be regarded as a part of this vast financial organization.\\n  Such patronage yields no inconsiderable part of the income of\\n  these banks and bankers and without much risk on account of the\\n  facilities of the principal groups for placing issues of securities\\n  through their domination of great banks and trust companies and\\n  their other domestic affiliations and their foreign connections.\\n  The underwriting commissions on issues made by this inner group\\n  are usually easily earned and do not ordinarily involve the\\n  underwriters in the purchase of the underwritten securities.\\n  Their interest in the transaction is generally adjusted unless\\n  they choose to purchase part of the securities, by the payment to\\n  them of a commission. There are, however, occasions on which this\\n  is not the case. The underwriters are then required to take the\\n  securities. Bankers and brokers are so anxious to be permitted to\\n  participate in these transactions under the lead of the inner group\\n  that as a rule they join when invited to do so, regardless of their\\n  approval of the particular business, lest by refusing they should\\n  thereafter cease to be invited.”\\n\\nIn other words, an invitation from these royal bankers is interpreted\\nas a command. As a result, these great bankers frequently get huge\\ncommissions without themselves distributing any of the bonds, or ever\\nhaving taken any actual risk.\\n\\n“In the case of the New York subway financing of $170,000,000 of bonds\\nby Messrs. Morgan & Co. and their associates, Mr. Davison [as the Pujo\\nCommittee reports] estimated that there were from 100 to 125 such\\nunderwriters who were apparently glad to agree that Messrs. Morgan\\n& Co., the First National Bank, and the National City Bank should\\nreceive 3 per cent.,--equal to $5,100,000--for forming this syndicate,\\nthus relieving themselves from all liability, whilst the underwriters\\nassumed the risk of what the bonds would realize and of being required\\nto take their share of the unsold portion.”\\n\\n\\nTHE PROTECTION OF PSEUDO-ETHICS\\n\\nThe organization of the Money Trust is intensive, the combination\\ncomprehensive; but one other element was recognized as necessary\\nto render it stable, and to make its dynamic force irresistible.\\nDespotism, be it financial or political, is vulnerable, unless it is\\nbelieved to rest upon a moral sanction. The longing for freedom is\\nineradicable. It will express itself in protest against servitude and\\ninaction, unless the striving for freedom be made to seem immoral.\\nLong ago monarchs invented, as a preservative of absolutism, the\\nfiction of “The divine right of kings.” Bankers, imitating royalty,\\ninvented recently that precious rule of so-called “Ethics,” by which\\nit is declared unprofessional to come to the financial relief of any\\ncorporation which is already the prey of another “reputable” banker.\\n\\n“The possibility of competition between these banking houses in the\\npurchase of securities,” says the Pujo Committee, “is further removed\\nby the understanding between them and others, that one will not seek,\\nby offering better terms, to take away from another, a customer which\\nit has theretofore served, and by corollary of this, namely, that where\\ngiven bankers have once satisfactorily united in bringing out an issue\\nof a corporation, they shall also join in bringing out any subsequent\\nissue of the same corporations. This is described as a principle of\\nbanking ethics.”\\n\\nThe “Ethical” basis of the rule must be that the interests of the\\ncombined bankers are superior to the interests of the rest of the\\ncommunity. Their attitude reminds one of the “spheres of influence”\\nwith ample “hinterlands” by which rapacious nations are adjusting\\ndifferences. Important banking concerns, too ambitious to be willing\\nto take a subordinate position in the alliance, and too powerful to\\nbe suppressed, are accorded a financial “sphere of influence” upon\\nthe understanding that the rule of banking ethics will be faithfully\\nobserved. Most prominent among such lesser potentates are Kuhn, Loeb\\n& Co., of New York, an international banking house of great wealth,\\nwith large clientele and connections. They are accorded an important\\n“sphere of influence” in American railroading, including among other\\nsystems the Baltimore & Ohio, the Union Pacific and the Southern\\nPacific. They and the Morgan group have with few exceptions preëmpted\\nthe banking business of the important railroads of the country. But\\neven Kuhn, Loeb & Co. are not wholly independent. The Pujo Committee\\nreports that they are “qualified allies of the inner group”; and\\nthrough their “close relations with the National City Bank and the\\nNational Bank of Commerce and other financial institutions” have “many\\ninterests in common with the Morgan associates, conducting large\\njoint-account operations with them.”\\n\\n\\nTHE EVILS RESULTANT\\n\\n_First:_ These banker-barons levy, through their excessive exactions,\\na heavy toll upon the whole community; upon owners of money for leave\\nto invest it; upon railroads, public service and industrial companies,\\nfor leave to use this money of other people; and, through these\\ncorporations, upon consumers.\\n\\n“The charge of capital,” says the Pujo Committee, “which of course\\nenters universally into the price of commodities and of service,\\nis thus in effect determined by agreement amongst those supplying\\nit and not under the check of competition. If there be any virtue\\nin the principle of competition, certainly any plan or arrangement\\nwhich prevents its operation in the performance of so fundamental\\na commercial function as the supplying of capital is peculiarly\\ninjurious.”\\n\\n_Second:_ More serious, however, is the effect of the Money Trust\\nin directly suppressing competition. That suppression enables the\\nmonopolist to extort excessive profits; but monopoly increases the\\nburden of the consumer even more in other ways. Monopoly arrests\\ndevelopment; and through arresting development, prevents that lessening\\nof the cost of production and of distribution which would otherwise\\ntake place.\\n\\nCan full competition exist among the anthracite coal railroads when the\\nMorgan associates are potent in all of them? And with like conditions\\nprevailing, what competition is to be expected between the Northern\\nPacific and the Great Northern, the Southern, the Louisville and\\nNashville, and the Atlantic Coast Line; or between the Westinghouse\\nManufacturing Company and the General Electric Company? As the Pujo\\nCommittee finds:\\n\\n“Such affiliations tend as a cover and conduit for secret arrangements\\nand understandings in restriction of competition through the agency of\\nthe banking house thus situated.”\\n\\nAnd under existing conditions of combination, relief through other\\nbanking houses is precluded.\\n\\n“It can hardly be expected that the banks, trust companies, and other\\ninstitutions that are thus seeking participation from this inner\\ngroup would be likely to engage in business of a character that would\\nbe displeasing to the latter or would interfere with their plans or\\nprestige. And so the protection that can be afforded by the members of\\nthe inner group constitutes the safest refuge of our great industrial\\ncombinations against future competition. The powerful grip of these\\ngentlemen is upon the throttle that controls the wheels of credit, and\\nupon their signal those wheels will turn or stop.”\\n\\n_Third:_ But far more serious even than the suppression of competition\\nis the suppression of industrial liberty, indeed of manhood itself,\\nwhich this overweening financial power entails. The intimidation which\\nit effects extends far beyond “the banks, trust companies, and other\\ninstitutions seeking participation from this inner group in their\\nlucrative underwritings”; and far beyond those interested in the great\\ncorporations directly dependent upon the inner group. Its blighting and\\nbenumbing effect extends as well to the small and seemingly independent\\nbusiness man, to the vast army of professional men and others directly\\ndependent upon “Big Business,” and to many another; for\\n\\n  1. Nearly every enterprising business man needs bank credit. The\\n  granting of credit involves the exercise of judgment of the bank\\n  officials; and however honestly the bank officials may wish to\\n  exercise their discretion, experience shows that their judgment is\\n  warped by the existence of the all-pervading power of the Money\\n  Trust. He who openly opposes the great interests will often be\\n  found to lack that quality of “safe and sane”-ness which is the\\n  basis of financial credit.\\n\\n  2. Nearly every enterprising business man and a large part of our\\n  professional men have something to sell to, or must buy something\\n  from, the great corporations to which the control or influence\\n  of the money lords extends directly, or from or to affiliated\\n  interests. Sometimes it is merchandise; sometimes it is service;\\n  sometimes they have nothing either to buy or to sell, but desire\\n  political or social advancement. Sometimes they want merely\\n  peace. Experience shows that “it is not healthy to buck against a\\n  locomotive,” and “Business is business.”\\n\\nHere and there you will find a hero,--red-blooded, and\\ncourageous,--loving manhood more than wealth, place or security,--who\\ndared to fight for independence and won. Here and there you may find\\nthe martyr, who resisted in silence and suffered with resignation. But\\nAmerica, which seeks “the greatest good of the greatest number,” cannot\\nbe content with conditions that fit only the hero, the martyr or the\\nslave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nINTERLOCKING DIRECTORATES\\n\\n\\nThe practice of interlocking directorates is the root of many evils.\\nIt offends laws human and divine. Applied to rival corporations,\\nit tends to the suppression of competition and to violation of the\\nSherman law. Applied to corporations which deal with each other, it\\ntends to disloyalty and to violation of the fundamental law that no\\nman can serve two masters. In either event it tends to inefficiency;\\nfor it removes incentive and destroys soundness of judgment. It is\\nundemocratic, for it rejects the platform: “A fair field and no\\nfavors,”--substituting the pull of privilege for the push of manhood.\\nIt is the most potent instrument of the Money Trust. Break the control\\nso exercised by the investment bankers over railroads, public-service\\nand industrial corporations, over banks, life insurance and trust\\ncompanies, and a long step will have been taken toward attainment of\\nthe New Freedom.\\n\\nThe term “Interlocking directorates” is here used in a broad sense\\nas including all intertwined conflicting interests, whatever the\\nform, and by whatever device effected. The objection extends alike\\nto contracts of a corporation whether with one of its directors\\nindividually, or with a firm of which he is a member, or with another\\ncorporation in which he is interested as an officer or director\\nor stockholder. The objection extends likewise to men holding the\\ninconsistent position of director in two potentially competing\\ncorporations, even if those corporations do not actually deal with each\\nother.\\n\\n\\nTHE ENDLESS CHAIN\\n\\nA single example will illustrate the vicious circle of control--the\\nendless chain--through which our financial oligarchy now operates:\\n\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan (or a partner), a director of the New York, New Haven &\\nHartford Railroad, causes that company to sell to J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.\\nan issue of bonds. J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. borrow the money with which to\\npay for the bonds from the Guaranty Trust Company, of which Mr. Morgan\\n(or a partner) is a director. J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. sell the bonds to the\\nPenn Mutual Life Insurance Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner)\\nis a director. The New Haven spends the proceeds of the bonds in\\npurchasing steel rails from the United States Steel Corporation, of\\nwhich Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The United States Steel\\nCorporation spends the proceeds of the rails in purchasing electrical\\nsupplies from the General Electric Company, of which Mr. Morgan (or\\na partner) is a director. The General Electric sells supplies to the\\nWestern Union Telegraph Company, a subsidiary of the American Telephone\\nand Telegraph Company; and in both Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a\\ndirector. The Telegraph Company has an exclusive wire contract with the\\nReading, of which Mr. Morgan (or a partner) is a director. The Reading\\nbuys its passenger cars from the Pullman Company, of which Mr. Morgan\\n(or a partner) is a director. The Pullman Company buys (for local use)\\nlocomotives from the Baldwin Locomotive Company, of which Mr. Morgan\\n(or a partner) is a director. The Reading, the General Electric, the\\nSteel Corporation and the New Haven, like the Pullman, buy locomotives\\nfrom the Baldwin Company. The Steel Corporation, the Telephone Company,\\nthe New Haven, the Reading, the Pullman and the Baldwin Companies,\\nlike the Western Union, buy electrical supplies from the General\\nElectric. The Baldwin, the Pullman, the Reading, the Telephone, the\\nTelegraph and the General Electric companies, like the New Haven, buy\\nsteel products from the Steel Corporation. Each and every one of the\\ncompanies last named markets its securities through J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.;\\neach deposits its funds with J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.; and with these funds\\nof each, the firm enters upon further operations.\\n\\nThis specific illustration is in part supposititious; but it represents\\ntruthfully the operation of interlocking directorates. Only it must be\\nmultiplied many times and with many permutations to represent fully the\\nextent to which the interests of a few men are intertwined. Instead of\\ntaking the New Haven as the railroad starting point in our example, the\\nNew York Central, the Santa Fé, the Southern, the Lehigh Valley, the\\nChicago and Great Western, the Erie or the Père Marquette might have\\nbeen selected; instead of the Guaranty Trust Company as the banking\\nreservoir, any one of a dozen other important banks or trust companies;\\ninstead of the Penn Mutual as purchaser of the bonds, other insurance\\ncompanies; instead of the General Electric, its qualified competitor,\\nthe Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. The chain is\\nindeed endless; for each controlled corporation is entwined with many\\nothers.\\n\\nAs the _nexus_ of “Big Business” the Steel Corporation stands, of\\ncourse, preëminent. The Stanley Committee showed that the few men who\\ncontrol the Steel Corporation, itself an owner of important railroads,\\nare directors also in twenty-nine other railroad systems, with 126,000\\nmiles of line (more than half the railroad mileage of the United\\nStates), and in important steamship companies. Through all these\\nalliances and the huge traffic it controls, the Steel Corporation’s\\ninfluence pervades railroad and steamship companies--not as carriers\\nonly--but as the largest customers for steel. And its influence with\\nusers of steel extends much further. These same few men are also\\ndirectors in twelve steel-using street railway systems, including some\\nof the largest in the world. They are directors in forty machinery\\nand similar steel-using manufacturing companies; in many gas, oil and\\nwater companies, extensive users of iron products; and in the great\\nwire-using telephone and telegraph companies. The aggregate assets of\\nthese different corporations--through which these few men exert their\\ninfluence over the business of the United States--exceeds sixteen\\nbillion dollars.\\n\\nObviously, interlocking directorates, and all that term implies, must\\nbe effectually prohibited before the freedom of American business can\\nbe regained. The prohibition will not be an innovation. It will merely\\ngive full legal sanction to the fundamental law of morals and of human\\nnature: that “No man can serve two masters.” The surprising fact is\\nthat a principle of equity so firmly rooted should have been departed\\nfrom at all in dealing with corporations. For no rule of law has,\\nin other connections, been more rigorously applied, than that which\\nprohibits a trustee from occupying inconsistent positions, from dealing\\nwith himself, or from using his fiduciary position for personal profit.\\nAnd a director of a corporation is as obviously a trustee as persons\\nholding similar positions in an unincorporated association, or in a\\nprivate trust estate, who are called specifically by that name. The\\nCourts have recognized this fully.\\n\\nThus, the Court of Appeals of New York declared in an important case:\\n\\n  “While not technically trustees, for the title of the corporate\\n  property was in the corporation itself, they were charged with the\\n  duties and subject to the liabilities of trustees. Clothed with\\n  the power of controlling the property and managing the affairs of\\n  the corporation without let or hindrance, as to third persons, they\\n  were its agents; but as to the corporation itself equity holds\\n  them liable as trustees. While courts of law generally treat the\\n  directors as agents, courts of equity treat them as trustees, and\\n  hold them to a strict account for any breach of the trust relation.\\n  For all practical purposes they are trustees, when called upon in\\n  equity to account for their official conduct.”\\n\\n\\nNULLIFYING THE LAW\\n\\nBut this wholesome rule of business, so clearly laid down, was\\npractically nullified by courts in creating two unfortunate\\nlimitations, as concessions doubtless to the supposed needs of\\ncommerce.\\n\\n_First:_ Courts held valid contracts between a corporation\\nand a director, or between two corporations with a common director,\\nwhere it was shown that in making the contract, the corporation\\nwas represented by independent directors and that the vote of the\\ninterested director was unnecessary to carry the motion and his\\npresence was not needed to constitute a quorum.\\n\\n_Second:_ Courts held that even where a common director participated\\nactively in the making of a contract between two corporations, the\\ncontract was not absolutely void, but voidable only at the election of\\nthe corporation.\\n\\nThe first limitation ignored the rule of law that a beneficiary is\\nentitled to disinterested advice from _all_ his trustees, and not\\nmerely from some; and that a trustee may violate his trust by inaction\\nas well as by action. It ignored, also, the laws of human nature, in\\nassuming that the influence of a director is confined to the act of\\nvoting. Every one knows that the most effective work is done before any\\nvote is taken, subtly, and without provable participation. Every one\\nshould know that the denial of minority representation on boards of\\ndirectors has resulted in the domination of most corporations by one\\nor two men; and in practically banishing all criticism of the dominant\\npower. And even where the board is not so dominated, there is too often\\nthat “harmonious coöperation” among directors which secures for each,\\nin his own line, a due share of the corporation’s favors.\\n\\nThe second limitation--by which contracts, in the making of which the\\ninterested director participates actively, are held _merely voidable_\\ninstead of absolutely void--ignores the teachings of experience.\\nTo hold such contracts merely voidable has resulted practically in\\ndeclaring them valid. It is the directors who control corporate action;\\nand there is little reason to expect that any contract, entered into by\\na board with a fellow director, however unfair, would be subsequently\\navoided. Appeals from Philip drunk to Philip sober are not of frequent\\noccurrence, nor very fruitful. But here we lack even an appealing\\nparty. Directors and the dominant stockholders would, of course, not\\nappeal; and the minority stockholders have rarely the knowledge of\\nfacts which is essential to an effective appeal, whether it be made to\\nthe directors, to the whole body of stockholders, or to the courts.\\nBesides, the financial burden and the risks incident to any attempt of\\nindividual stockholders to interfere with an existing management is\\nordinarily prohibitive. Proceedings to avoid contracts with directors\\nare, therefore, seldom brought, except after a radical change in the\\nmembership of the board. And radical changes in a board’s membership\\nare rare. Indeed the Pujo Committee reports:\\n\\n  “None of the witnesses (the leading American bankers testified)\\n  was able to name an instance in the history of the country in\\n  which the stockholders had succeeded in overthrowing an existing\\n  management in any large corporation. Nor does it appear that\\n  stockholders have ever even succeeded in so far as to secure\\n  the investigation of an existing management of a corporation to\\n  ascertain whether it has been well or honestly managed.”\\n\\nMr. Max Pam proposed in the April, 1913, Harvard Law Review, that the\\ngovernment come to the aid of minority stockholders. He urged that\\nthe president of every corporation be required to report annually to\\nthe stockholders, and to state and federal officials every contract\\nmade by the company in which any director is interested; that the\\nAttorney-General of the United States or the State investigate\\nthe same and take proper proceedings to set all such contracts\\naside and recover any damages suffered; or without disaffirming\\nthe contracts to recover from the interested directors the profits\\nderived therefrom. And to this end also, that State and National Bank\\nExaminers, State Superintendents of Insurance, and the Interstate\\nCommerce Commission be directed to examine the records of every bank,\\ntrust company, insurance company, railroad company and every other\\ncorporation engaged in interstate commerce. Mr. Pam’s views concerning\\ninterlocking directorates are entitled to careful study. As counsel\\nprominently identified with the organization of trusts, he had for\\nyears full opportunity of weighing the advantages and disadvantages\\nof “Big Business.” His conviction that the practice of interlocking\\ndirectorates is a menace to the public and demands drastic legislation,\\nis significant. And much can be said in support of the specific measure\\nwhich he proposes. But to be effective, the remedy must be fundamental\\nand comprehensive.\\n\\n\\nTHE ESSENTIALS OF PROTECTION\\n\\nProtection to minority stockholders demands that corporations be\\nprohibited absolutely from making contracts in which a director has a\\nprivate interest, and that all such contracts be declared not voidable\\nmerely, but absolutely void.\\n\\nIn the case of railroads and public-service corporations (in\\ncontradistinction to private industrial companies), such prohibition\\nis demanded, also, in the interests of the general public. For\\ninterlocking interests breed inefficiency and disloyalty; and the\\npublic pays, in higher rates or in poor service, a large part of the\\npenalty for graft and inefficiency. Indeed, whether rates are adequate\\nor excessive cannot be determined until it is known whether the gross\\nearnings of the corporation are properly expended. For when a company’s\\nimportant contracts are made through directors who are interested on\\nboth sides, the common presumption that money spent has been properly\\nspent does not prevail. And this is particularly true in railroading,\\nwhere the company so often lacks effective competition in its own field.\\n\\nBut the compelling reason for prohibiting interlocking directorates\\nis neither the protection of stockholders, nor the protection of\\nthe public from the incidents of inefficiency and graft. Conclusive\\nevidence (if obtainable) that the practice of interlocking directorates\\nbenefited all stockholders and was the most efficient form of\\norganization, would not remove the objections. For even more important\\nthan efficiency are industrial and political liberty; and these are\\nimperiled by the Money Trust. _Interlocking directorates must be\\nprohibited, because it is impossible to break the Money Trust without\\nputting an end to the practice in the larger corporations._\\n\\n\\nBANKS AS PUBLIC-SERVICE CORPORATIONS\\n\\nThe practice of interlocking directorates is peculiarly objectionable\\nwhen applied to banks, because of the nature and functions of those\\ninstitutions. Bank deposits are an important part of our currency\\nsystem. They are almost as essential a factor in commerce as our\\nrailways. Receiving deposits and making loans therefrom should be\\ntreated by the law not as a private business, but as one of the public\\nservices. And recognizing it to be such, the law already regulates\\nit in many ways. The function of a bank is to receive and to loan\\nmoney. It has no more right than a common carrier to use its powers\\nspecifically to build up or to destroy other businesses. The granting\\nor withholding of a loan should be determined, so far as concerns the\\nborrower, solely by the interest rate and the risk involved; and not\\nby favoritism or other considerations foreign to the banking function.\\nMen may safely be allowed to grant or to deny loans of their _own_\\nmoney to whomsoever they see fit, whatsoever their motive may be. But\\nbank resources are, in the main, not owned by the stockholders nor by\\nthe directors. Nearly three-fourths of the aggregate resources of the\\nthirty-four banking institutions in which the Morgan associates hold\\na predominant influence are represented by deposits. The dependence of\\ncommerce and industry upon bank deposits, as the common reservoir of\\nquick capital is so complete, that deposit banking should be recognized\\nas one of the businesses “affected with a public interest.” And the\\ngeneral rule which forbids public-service corporations from making\\nunjust discriminations or giving undue preference should be applied to\\nthe operations of such banks.\\n\\nSenator Owen, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency, said\\nrecently:\\n\\n  “My own judgment is that a bank is a public-utility institution and\\n  cannot be treated as a private affair, for the simple reason that\\n  the public is invited, under the safeguards of the government, to\\n  deposit its money with the bank, and the public has a right to have\\n  its interests safeguarded through organized authorities. The logic\\n  of this is beyond escape. All banks in the United States, public\\n  and private, should be treated as public-utility institutions,\\n  where they receive public deposits.”\\n\\nThe directors and officers of banking institutions must, of course, be\\nentrusted with wide discretion in the granting or denying of loans.\\nBut that discretion should be exercised, not only honestly as it\\naffects stockholders, but also impartially as it affects the public.\\nMere honesty to the stockholders demands that the interests to be\\nconsidered by the directors be the interests of all the stockholders;\\nnot the profit of the part of them who happen to be its directors.\\nBut the general welfare demands of the director, as trustee for the\\npublic, performance of a stricter duty. The fact that the granting of\\nloans involves a delicate exercise of discretion makes it difficult\\nto determine whether the rule of equality of treatment, which every\\npublic-service corporation owes, has been performed. But that\\ndifficulty merely emphasizes the importance of making absolute the\\nrule that banks of deposit shall not make any loan nor engage in any\\ntransaction in which a director has a private interest. And we should\\nbear this in mind: If privately-owned banks fail in the public duty to\\nafford borrowers equality of opportunity, there will arise a demand for\\ngovernment-owned banks, which will become irresistible.\\n\\nThe statement of Mr. Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court of the United\\nStates, in the Oklahoma Bank case, is significant:\\n\\n“We cannot say that the public interests to which we have adverted,\\nand others, are not sufficient to warrant the State in taking the\\nwhole business of banking under its control. On the contrary we are of\\nopinion that it may go on from regulation to prohibition except upon\\nsuch conditions as it may prescribe.”\\n\\n\\nOFFICIAL PRECEDENTS\\n\\nNor would the requirement that banks shall make no loan in which a\\ndirector has a private interest impose undue hardships or restrictions\\nupon bank directors. It might make a bank director dispose of some of\\nhis investments and refrain from making others; but it often happens\\nthat the holding of one office precludes a man from holding another, or\\ncompels him to dispose of certain financial interests.\\n\\nA judge is disqualified from sitting in any case in which he has even\\nthe smallest financial interest; and most judges, in order to be free\\nto act in any matters arising in their court, proceed, upon taking\\noffice, to dispose of all investments which could conceivably bias\\ntheir judgment in any matter that might come before them. An Interstate\\nCommerce Commissioner is prohibited from owning any bonds or stocks in\\nany corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. It is\\na serious criminal offence for any executive officer of the federal\\ngovernment to transact government business with any corporation in the\\npecuniary profits of which he is directly or indirectly interested.\\n\\nAnd the directors of our great banking institutions, as the ultimate\\njudges of bank credit, exercise today a function no less important\\nto the country’s welfare than that of the judges of our courts, the\\ninterstate commerce commissioners, and departmental heads.\\n\\n\\nSCOPE OF THE PROHIBITION\\n\\nIn the proposals for legislation on this subject, four important\\nquestions are presented:\\n\\n1. Shall the principle of prohibiting interlocking directorates\\nin potentially competing corporations be applied to state banking\\ninstitutions, as well as the national banks?\\n\\n2. Shall it be applied to all kinds of corporations or only to banking\\ninstitutions?\\n\\n3. Shall the principle of prohibiting corporations from entering into\\ntransactions in which the management has a private interest be applied\\nto both directors and officers or be confined in its application to\\nofficers only?\\n\\n4. Shall the principle be applied so as to prohibit transactions with\\nanother corporation in which one of its directors is interested merely\\nas a stockholder?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nSERVE ONE MASTER ONLY\\n\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee has presented the facts concerning the Money Trust\\nso clearly that the conclusions appear inevitable. Their diagnosis\\ndiscloses intense financial concentration and the means by which it is\\neffected. Combination,--the intertwining of interests,--is shown to be\\nthe all-pervading vice of the present system. With a view to freeing\\nindustry, the Committee recommends the enactment of twenty-one specific\\nremedial provisions. Most of these measures are wisely framed to meet\\nsome abuse disclosed by the evidence; and if all of these were adopted\\nthe Pujo legislation would undoubtedly alleviate present suffering and\\naid in arresting the disease. But many of the remedies proposed are\\n“local” ones; and a cure is not possible, without treatment which is\\nfundamental. Indeed, a major operation is necessary. This the Committee\\nhas hesitated to advise; although the fundamental treatment required is\\nsimple: “Serve one Master only.”\\n\\nThe evils incident to interlocking directorates are, of course,\\nfully recognized; but the prohibitions proposed in that respect are\\nrestricted to a very narrow sphere.\\n\\n_First:_ The Committee recognizes that potentially competing\\ncorporations should not have a common director;--but it restricts this\\nprohibition to directors of national banks, saying:\\n\\n“No officer or director of a national bank shall be an officer or\\ndirector of any other bank or of any trust company or other financial\\nor other corporation or institution, whether organized under state or\\nfederal law, that is authorized to receive money on deposit or that is\\nengaged in the business of loaning money on collateral or in buying and\\nselling securities except as in this section provided; and no person\\nshall be an officer or director of any national bank who is a private\\nbanker or a member of a firm or partnership of bankers that is engaged\\nin the business of receiving deposits: Provided, That such bank, trust\\ncompany, financial institution, banker, or firm of bankers is located\\nat or engaged in business at or in the same city, town, or village as\\nthat in which such national bank is located or engaged in business:\\nProvided further, That a director of a national bank or a partner of\\nsuch director may be an officer or director of not more than one trust\\ncompany organized by the laws of the state in which such national bank\\nis engaged in business and doing business at the same place.”\\n\\n_Second:_ The Committee recognizes that a corporation should not make\\na contract in which one of the management has a private interest; but\\nit restricts this prohibition (1) to national banks, and (2) to the\\nofficers, saying:\\n\\n“No national bank shall lend or advance money or credit or purchase or\\ndiscount any promissory note, draft, bill of exchange or other evidence\\nof debt bearing the signature or indorsement of any of its officers\\nor of any partnership of which such officer is a member, directly\\nor indirectly, or of any corporation in which such officer owns or\\nhas a beneficial interest of upward of ten per centum of the capital\\nstock, or lend or advance money or credit to, for or on behalf of any\\nsuch officer or of any such partnership or corporation, or purchase\\nany security from any such officer or of or from any partnership\\nor corporation of which such officer is a member or in which he is\\nfinancially interested, as herein specified, or of any corporation\\nof which any of its officers is an officer at the time of such\\ntransaction.”\\n\\nProhibitions of intertwining relations so restricted, however\\nsupplemented by other provisions, will not end financial concentration.\\nThe Money Trust snake will, at most, be scotched, not killed. The\\nprohibition of a common director in potentially competing corporations\\nshould apply to state banks and trust companies, as well as to national\\nbanks; and it should apply to railroad and industrial corporations\\nas fully as to banking institutions. The prohibition of corporate\\ncontracts in which one of the management has a private interest should\\napply to directors, as well as to officers, and to state banks and\\ntrust companies and to other classes of corporations, as well as to\\nnational banks. And, as will be hereafter shown, such broad legislation\\nis within the power of Congress.\\n\\nLet us examine this further:\\n\\n\\nTHE PROHIBITION OF COMMON DIRECTORS IN POTENTIALLY COMPETING\\nCORPORATIONS\\n\\n1. _National Banks._ The objection to common directors, as applied to\\nbanking institutions, is clearly shown by the Pujo Committee.\\n\\n“As the first and foremost step in applying a remedy, and also\\nfor reasons that seem to us conclusive, independently of that\\nconsideration, we recommend that interlocking directorates in\\npotentially competing financial institutions be abolished and\\nprohibited so far as lies in the power of Congress to bring about that\\nresult.... When we find, as in a number of instances, the same man a\\ndirector in half a dozen or more banks and trust companies all located\\nin the same section of the same city, doing the same class of business\\nand with a like set of associates similarly situated, all belonging\\nto the same group and representing the same class of interests, all\\nfurther pretense of competition is useless.... If banks serving the\\nsame field are to be permitted to have common directors, genuine\\ncompetition will be rendered impossible. Besides, this practice gives\\nto such common directors the unfair advantage of knowing the affairs of\\nborrowers in various banks, and thus affords endless opportunities for\\noppression.”\\n\\nThis recommendation is in accordance with the legislation or practice\\nof other countries. The Bank of England, the Bank of France, the\\nNational Bank of Belgium, and the leading banks of Scotland all\\nexclude from their boards persons who are directors in other banks. By\\nlaw, in Russia no person is allowed to be on the board of management of\\nmore than one bank.\\n\\nThe Committee’s recommendation is also in harmony with laws enacted by\\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts more than a generation ago designed\\nto curb financial concentration through the savings banks. Of the great\\nwealth of Massachusetts a large part is represented by deposits in\\nits savings banks. These deposits are distributed among 194 different\\nbanks, located in 131 different cities and towns. These 194 banks are\\nseparate and distinct; not only in form, but in fact. In order that the\\nbanks may not be controlled by a few financiers, the Massachusetts law\\nprovides that no executive officer or trustee (director) of any savings\\nbank can hold any office in any other savings bank. That statute was\\npassed in 1876. A few years ago it was supplemented by providing\\nthat none of the executive officers of a savings bank could hold a\\nsimilar office in any national bank. Massachusetts attempted thus\\nto curb the power of the individual financier; and no disadvantages\\nare discernible. When that Act was passed the aggregate deposits in\\nits savings banks were $243,340,642; the number of deposit accounts\\n739,289; the average deposit to each person of the population $144.\\nOn November 1, 1912, the aggregate deposits were $838,635,097.85; the\\nnumber of deposit accounts 2,200,917; the average deposit to each\\naccount $381.04. Massachusetts has shown that curbing the power of the\\nfew, at least in this respect, is entirely consistent with efficiency\\nand with the prosperity of the whole people.\\n\\n2. _State Banks and Trust Companies._ The reason for prohibiting common\\ndirectors in banking institutions applies equally to national banks and\\nto state banks including those trust companies which are essentially\\nbanks. In New York City there are 37 trust companies of which only\\n15 are members of the clearing house; but those 15 had on November\\n2, 1912, aggregate resources of $827,875,653. Indeed the Bankers’\\nTrust Company with resources of $205,000,000, and the Guaranty Trust\\nCompany, with resources of $232,000,000, are among the most useful\\ntools of the Money Trust. No bank in the country has larger deposits\\nthan the latter; and only one bank larger deposits than the former.\\nIf common directorships were permitted in state banks or such trust\\ncompanies, the charters of leading national banks would doubtless soon\\nbe surrendered; and the institutions would elude federal control by\\nre-incorporating under state laws.\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee has failed to apply the prohibition of common\\ndirectorships in potentially competing banking institutions rigorously\\neven to national banks. It permits the same man to be a director in one\\nnational bank and one trust company doing business in the same place.\\nThe proposed concession opens the door to grave dangers. In the first\\nplace the provision would permit the interlocking of any national bank\\nnot with one trust company only, but with as many trust companies as\\nthe bank has directors. For while under the Pujo bill no one can be\\na national bank director who is director in more than one such trust\\ncompany, there is nothing to prevent each of the directors of a bank\\nfrom becoming a director in a different trust company. The National\\nBank of Commerce of New York has a board of 38 directors. There are\\n37 trust companies in the City of New York. Thirty-seven of the 38\\ndirectors might each become a director of a different New York trust\\ncompany: and thus 37 trust companies would be interlocked with the\\nNational Bank of Commerce, unless the other recommendation of the Pujo\\nCommittee limiting the number of directors to 13 were also adopted.\\n\\nBut even if the bill were amended so as to limit the possible\\ninterlocking of a bank to a single trust company, the wisdom of the\\nconcession would still be doubtful. It is true, as the Pujo Committee\\nstates, that “the business that may be transacted by” a trust company\\nis of “a different character” from that properly transacted by a\\nnational bank. But the business actually conducted by a trust company\\nis, at least in the East, quite similar; and the two classes of banking\\ninstitutions have these vital elements in common: each is a bank of\\ndeposit, and each makes loans from its deposits. A private banker may\\nalso transact some business of a character different from that properly\\nconducted by a bank; but by the terms of the Committee’s bill a private\\nbanker engaged in the business of receiving deposits would be prevented\\nfrom being a director of a national bank; and the reasons underlying\\nthat prohibition apply equally to trust companies and to private\\nbankers.\\n\\n3. _Other Corporations._ The interlocking of banking institutions\\nis only one of the factors which have developed the Money Trust.\\nThe interlocking of other corporations has been an equally important\\nelement. And the prohibition of interlocking directorates should be\\nextended to potentially competing corporations whatever the class; to\\nlife insurance companies, railroads and industrial companies, as well\\nas banking institutions. The Pujo Committee has shown that Mr. George\\nF. Baker is a common director in the six railroads which haul 80 per\\ncent. of all anthracite marketed and own 88 per cent. of all anthracite\\ndeposits. The Morgan associates are the _nexus_ between such supposedly\\ncompeting railroads as the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern; the\\nSouthern, the Louisville & Nashville and the Atlantic Coast Line, and\\nbetween partially competing industrials like the Westinghouse Electric\\nand Manufacturing Company and the General Electric. The _nexus_ between\\nall the large potentially competing corporations must be severed, if\\nthe Money Trust is to be broken.\\n\\n\\nPROHIBITING CORPORATE CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE MANAGEMENT HAS A PRIVATE\\nINTEREST\\n\\nThe principle of prohibiting corporate contracts in which the\\nmanagement has a private interest is applied, in the Pujo Committee’s\\nrecommendations, only to national banks, and in them only to officers.\\nAll other corporations are to be permitted to continue the practice;\\nand even in national banks the directors are to be free to have\\na conflicting private interest, except that they must not accept\\ncompensation for promoting a loan of bank funds nor participate in\\nsyndicates, promotions or underwriting of securities in which their\\nbanks may be interested as underwriters or owners or lenders thereon:\\nthat all loans or other transactions in which a director is interested\\nshall be made in his own name; and shall be authorized only after ample\\nnotice to co-directors; and that the facts shall be spread upon the\\nrecords of the corporation.\\n\\nThe Money Trust would not be disturbed by a prohibition limited to\\nofficers. Under a law of that character, financial control would\\ncontinue to be exercised by the few without substantial impairment; but\\nthe power would be exerted through a somewhat different channel. Bank\\nofficers are appointees of the directors; and ordinarily their obedient\\nservants. Individuals who, as bank officers, are now important factors\\nin the financial concentration, would doubtless resign as officers\\nand become merely directors. The loss of official salaries involved\\ncould be easily compensated. No member of the firm of J.\\xa0P. Morgan\\n& Co. is an officer in any one of the thirteen banking institutions\\nwith aggregate resources of $1,283,000,000, through which as directors\\nthey carry on their vast operations. A prohibition limited to officers\\nwould not affect the Morgan operations with these banking institutions.\\nIf there were minority representation on bank boards (which the Pujo\\nCommittee wisely advocates), such a provision might afford some\\nprotection to stockholders through the vigilance of the minority\\ndirectors preventing the dominant directors using their power to the\\ninjury of the minority stockholders. But even then, the provision\\nwould not safeguard the public; and the primary purpose of Money Trust\\nlegislation is not to prevent directors from injuring stockholders; but\\nto prevent their injuring the public through the intertwined control of\\nthe banks. No prohibition limited to officers will materially change\\nthis condition.\\n\\nThe prohibition of interlocking directorates, even if applied only to\\nall banks and trust companies, would practically compel the Morgan\\nrepresentatives to resign from the directorates of the thirteen\\nbanking institutions with which they are connected, or from the\\ndirectorates of all the railroads, express, steamship, public utility,\\nmanufacturing, and other corporations which do business with those\\nbanks and trust companies. Whether they resigned from the one or the\\nother class of corporations, the endless chain would be broken into\\nmany pieces. And whether they retired or not, the Morgan power would\\nobviously be greatly lessened: for if they did not retire, their field\\nof operations would be greatly narrowed.\\n\\n\\nAPPLY THE PRIVATE INTEREST PROHIBITION TO ALL KINDS OF CORPORATIONS\\n\\nThe creation of the Money Trust is due quite as much to the\\nencroachment of the investment banker upon railroads, public service,\\nindustrial, and life-insurance companies, as to his control of banks\\nand trust companies. Before the Money Trust can be broken, all\\nthese relations must be severed. And they cannot be severed unless\\ncorporations of each of these several classes are prevented from\\ndealing with their own directors and with corporations in which those\\ndirectors are interested. For instance: The most potent single source\\nof J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.’s power is the $162,500,000 deposits, including\\nthose of 78 interstate railroad, public-service and industrial\\ncorporations, which the Morgan firm is free to use as it sees fit. The\\nproposed prohibition, even if applied to all banking institutions,\\nwould not affect directly this great source of Morgan power. If,\\nhowever, the prohibition is made to include railroad, public-service,\\nand industrial corporations, as well as banking institutions, members\\nof J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. will quickly retire from substantially all boards\\nof directors.\\n\\n\\nAPPLY THE PRIVATE INTEREST PROHIBITION TO STOCKHOLDING INTERESTS\\n\\nThe prohibition against one corporation entering into transactions with\\nanother corporation in which one of its directors is also interested,\\nshould apply even if his interest in the second corporation is merely\\nthat of stockholder. A conflict of interests in a director may be just\\nas serious where he is a stockholder only in the second corporation, as\\nif he were also a director.\\n\\nOne of the annoying petty monopolies, concerning which evidence was\\ntaken by the Pujo Committee, is the exclusive privilege granted to the\\nAmerican Bank Note Company by the New York Stock Exchange. A recent\\n$60,000,000 issue of New York City bonds was denied listing on the\\nExchange, because the city refused to submit to an exaction of $55,800\\nby the American Company for engraving the bonds, when the New York Bank\\nNote Company would do the work equally well for $44,500. As tending to\\nexplain this extraordinary monopoly, it was shown that men prominent in\\nthe financial world were stockholders in the American Company. Among\\nthe largest stockholders was Mr. Morgan, with 6,000 shares. No member\\nof the Morgan firm was a director of the American Company; but there\\nwas sufficient influence exerted somehow to give the American Company\\nthe stock exchange monopoly.\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee, while failing to recommend that transactions in\\nwhich a director has a private interest be prohibited, recognizes\\nthat a stockholder’s interest of more than a certain size may be as\\npotent an instrument of influence as a direct personal interest; for it\\nrecommends that:\\n\\n  “Borrowings, directly or indirectly by ... any corporation of\\n  the stock of which he (a bank director) holds upwards of 10 per\\n  cent. from the bank of which he is such director, should only be\\n  permitted, on condition that notice shall have been given to his\\n  co-directors and that a full statement of the transaction shall\\n  be entered upon the minutes of the meeting at which such loan was\\n  authorized.”\\n\\nAs shown above, the particular provision for notice affords no\\nprotection to the public; but if it did, its application ought to be\\nextended to lesser stockholdings. Indeed it is difficult to fix a limit\\nso low that financial interest will not influence action. Certainly\\na stockholding interest of a single director, much smaller than 10\\nper cent., might be most effective in inducing favors. Mr. Morgan’s\\nstockholdings in the American Bank Note Company was only three per\\ncent. The $6,000,000 investment of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. in the National\\nCity Bank represented only 6 per cent. of the bank’s stock; and would\\nundoubtedly have been effective, even if it had not been supplemented\\nby the election of his son to the board of directors.\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL DISQUALIFICATIONS\\n\\nThe Stanley Committee, after investigation of the Steel Trust,\\nconcluded that the evils of interlocking directorates were so serious\\nthat representatives of certain industries which are largely dependent\\nupon railroads should be absolutely prohibited from serving as railroad\\ndirectors, officers or employees. It, therefore, proposed to disqualify\\nas railroad director, officer or employee any person engaged in the\\nbusiness of manufacturing or selling railroad cars or locomotives,\\nrailroad rail or structural steel, or in mining and selling coal. The\\ndrastic Stanley bill, shows how great is the desire to do away with\\npresent abuses and to lessen the power of the Money Trust.\\n\\nDirectors, officers, and employees of banking institutions should, by a\\nsimilar provision, be disqualified from acting as directors, officers\\nor employees of life-insurance companies. The Armstrong investigation\\nshowed that life-insurance companies were in 1905 the most potent\\nfactor in financial concentration. Their power was exercised largely\\nthrough the banks and trust companies which they controlled by stock\\nownership and their huge deposits. The Armstrong legislation directed\\nlife-insurance companies to sell their stocks. The Mutual Life and\\nthe Equitable did so in part. But the Morgan associates bought the\\nstocks. And now, instead of the life-insurance companies controlling\\nthe banks and trust companies, the latter and the bankers control the\\nlife-insurance companies.\\n\\n\\nHOW THE PROHIBITION MAY BE LIMITED\\n\\nThe Money Trust cannot be destroyed unless all _classes_ of\\ncorporations are included in the prohibition of interlocking directors\\nand of transactions by corporations in which the management has a\\nprivate interest. But it does not follow that the prohibition must\\napply to _every_ corporation of each class. Certain exceptions are\\nentirely consistent with merely protecting the public against the Money\\nTrust; although protection of minority stockholders and business ethics\\ndemand that the rule prohibiting a corporation from making contracts in\\nwhich a director has a private financial interest should be universal\\nin its application. The number of corporations in the United States\\nDec. 31, 1912, was 305,336. Of these only 1610 have a capital of more\\nthan $5,000,000. Few corporations (other than banks) with a capital\\nof less than $5,000,000 could appreciably affect general credit\\nconditions either through their own operations or their affiliations.\\nCorporations (other than banks) with capital resources of less than\\n$5,000,000 might, therefore, be excluded from the scope of the statute\\nfor the present. The prohibition could also be limited so as not to\\napply to any industrial concern, regardless of the amount of capital\\nand resources, doing only an intrastate business; as practically all\\nlarge industrial corporations are engaged in interstate commerce. This\\nwould exclude some retail concerns and local jobbers and manufacturers\\nnot otherwise excluded from the operation of the act. Likewise banks\\nand trust companies located in cities of less than 100,000 inhabitants\\nmight, if thought advisable, be excluded, for the present if their\\ncapital is less than $500,000, and their resources less than, say,\\n$2,500,000. In larger cities even the smaller banking institutions\\nshould be subject to the law. Such exceptions should overcome any\\nobjection which might be raised that in some smaller cities, the\\nprohibition of interlocking directorates would exclude from the bank\\ndirectorates all the able business men of the community through fear of\\nlosing the opportunity of bank accommodations.\\n\\nAn exception should also be made, so as to permit interlocking\\ndirectorates between a corporation and its proper subsidiaries. And\\nthe prohibition of transactions in which the management has a private\\ninterest should, of course, not apply to contracts, express or\\nimplied, for such services as are performed indiscriminately for the\\nwhole community by railroads and public service corporations, or for\\nservices, common to all customers, like the ordinary service of a bank\\nfor its depositors.\\n\\n\\nTHE POWER OF CONGRESS\\n\\nThe question may be asked: Has Congress the power to impose these\\nlimitations upon the conduct of any business other than national banks?\\nAnd if the power of Congress is so limited, will not the dominant\\nfinanciers, upon the enactment of such a law, convert their national\\nbanks into state banks or trust companies, and thus escape from\\ncongressional control?\\n\\nThe answer to both questions is clear. Congress has ample power to\\nimpose such prohibitions upon practically all corporations, including\\nstate banks, trust companies and life insurance companies; and evasion\\nmay be made impossible. While Congress has not been granted power to\\nregulate _directly_ state banks, and trust or life insurance companies,\\nor railroad, public-service and industrial corporations, except in\\nrespect to interstate commerce, it may do so _indirectly_ by virtue\\neither of its control of the mail privilege or through the taxing power.\\n\\nPractically no business in the United States can be conducted without\\nuse of the mails; and Congress may in its reasonable discretion\\ndeny the use of the mail to any business which is conducted under\\nconditions deemed by Congress to be injurious to the public welfare.\\nThus, Congress has no power directly to suppress lotteries; but it has\\nindirectly suppressed them by denying, under heavy penalty, the use\\nof the mail to lottery enterprises. Congress has no power to suppress\\ndirectly business frauds; but it is constantly doing so indirectly by\\nissuing fraud-orders denying the mail privilege. Congress has no direct\\npower to require a newspaper to publish a list of its proprietors and\\nthe amount of its circulation, or to require it to mark paid-matter\\ndistinctly as advertising: But it has thus regulated the press, by\\ndenying the second-class mail privilege, to all publications which fail\\nto comply with the requirements prescribed.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe taxing power has been resorted to by Congress for like purposes:\\nCongress has no power to regulate the manufacture of matches, or\\nthe use of oleomargarine; but it has suppressed the manufacture of\\nthe “white phosphorous” match and has greatly lessened the use of\\noleomargarine by imposing heavy taxes upon them. Congress has no power\\nto prohibit, or to regulate directly the issue of bank notes by state\\nbanks, but it indirectly prohibited their issue by imposing a tax of\\nten per cent. upon any bank note issued by a state bank.\\n\\nThe power of Congress over interstate commerce has been similarly\\nutilized. Congress cannot ordinarily provide compensation for accidents\\nto employees or undertake directly to suppress prostitution; but it\\nhas, as an incident of regulating interstate commerce, enacted the\\nRailroad Employers’ Liability law and the White Slave Law; and it has\\nfull power over the instrumentalities of commerce, like the telegraph\\nand the telephone.\\n\\nAs such exercise of congressional power has been common for, at least,\\nhalf a century, Congress should not hesitate now to employ it where\\nits exercise is urgently needed. For a comprehensive prohibition of\\ninterlocking directorates is an essential condition of our attaining\\nthe New Freedom. Such a law would involve a great change in the\\nrelation of the leading banks and bankers to other businesses. But\\nit is the very purpose of Money Trust legislation to effect a great\\nchange; and unless it does so, the power of our financial oligarchy\\ncannot be broken.\\n\\nBut though the enactment of such a law is essential to the emancipation\\nof business, it will not _alone_ restore industrial liberty. It must be\\nsupplemented by other remedial measures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nWHAT PUBLICITY CAN DO\\n\\n\\nPublicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial\\ndiseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric\\nlight the most efficient policeman. And publicity has already played\\nan important part in the struggle against the Money Trust. The Pujo\\nCommittee has, in the disclosure of the facts concerning financial\\nconcentration, made a most important contribution toward attainment of\\nthe New Freedom. The battlefield has been surveyed and charted. The\\nhostile forces have been located, counted and appraised. That was a\\nnecessary first step--and a long one--towards relief. The provisions in\\nthe Committee’s bill concerning the incorporation of stock exchanges\\nand the statement to be made in connection with the listing of\\nsecurities would doubtless have a beneficent effect. But there should\\nbe a further call upon publicity for service. That potent force must,\\nin the impending struggle, be utilized in many ways as a continuous\\nremedial measure.\\n\\n\\nWEALTH\\n\\nCombination and control of other people’s money and of other people’s\\nbusinesses. These are the main factors in the development of the Money\\nTrust. But the wealth of the investment banker is also a factor. And\\nwith the extraordinary growth of his wealth in recent years, the\\nrelative importance of wealth as a factor in financial concentration\\nhas grown steadily. It was wealth which enabled Mr. Morgan, in 1910,\\nto pay $3,000,000 for $51,000 par value of the stock of the Equitable\\nLife Insurance Society. His direct income from this investment was\\nlimited by law to less than one-eighth of one per cent. a year; but\\nit gave legal control of $504,000,000, of assets. It was wealth which\\nenabled the Morgan associates to buy from the Equitable and the Mutual\\nLife Insurance Company the stocks in the several banking institutions,\\nwhich, merged in the Bankers’ Trust Company and the Guaranty Trust\\nCompany, gave them control of $357,000,000 deposits. It was wealth\\nwhich enabled Mr. Morgan to acquire his shares in the First National\\nand National City banks, worth $21,000,000, through which he cemented\\nthe triple alliance with those institutions.\\n\\nNow, how has this great wealth been accumulated? Some of it was natural\\naccretion. Some of it is due to special opportunities for investment\\nwisely availed of. Some of it is due to the vast extent of the bankers’\\noperations. Then power breeds wealth as wealth breeds power. But a main\\ncause of these large fortunes is the huge tolls taken by those who\\ncontrol the avenues to capital and to investors. There has been exacted\\nas toll literally “all that the traffic will bear.”\\n\\n\\nEXCESSIVE BANKERS’ COMMISSIONS\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee was unfortunately prevented by lack of time from\\npresenting to the country the evidence covering the amounts taken by\\nthe investment bankers as promoters’ fees, underwriting commissions and\\nprofits. Nothing could have demonstrated so clearly the power exercised\\nby the bankers, as a schedule showing the aggregate of these taxes\\nlevied within recent years. It would be well worth while now to re-open\\nthe Money Trust investigation merely to collect these data. But earlier\\ninvestigations have disclosed some illuminating, though sporadic facts.\\n\\nThe syndicate which promoted the Steel Trust, took, as compensation\\nfor a few weeks’ work, securities yielding $62,500,000 in cash;\\nand of this, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. received for their services, as\\nSyndicate Managers, $12,500,000, besides their share, as syndicate\\nsubscribers, in the remaining $50,000,000. The Morgan syndicate took\\nfor promoting the Tube Trust $20,000,000 common stock out of a total\\nissue of $80,000,000 stock (preferred and common). Nor were monster\\ncommissions limited to trust promotions. More recently, bankers’\\nsyndicates have, in many instances, received for floating preferred\\nstocks of recapitalized industrial concerns, one-third of all common\\nstock issued, besides a considerable sum in cash. And for the sale\\nof preferred stock of well established manufacturing concerns, cash\\ncommissions (or profits) of from 7 1/2 to 10 per cent. of the cash\\nraised are often exacted. On bonds of high-class industrial concerns,\\nbankers’ commissions (or profits) of from 5 to 10 points have been\\ncommon.\\n\\nNor have these heavy charges been confined to industrial concerns. Even\\nrailroad securities, supposedly of high grade, have been subjected\\nto like burdens. At a time when the New Haven’s credit was still\\nunimpaired, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. took the New York, Westchester & Boston\\nRailway first mortgage bonds, guaranteed by the New Haven at 92 1/2;\\nand they were marketed at 96 1/4. They took the Portland Terminal\\nCompany bonds, guaranteed by the Maine Central Railroad--a corporation\\nof unquestionable credit--at about 88, and these were marketed at 92.\\n\\nA large part of these underwriting commissions is taken by the great\\nbanking houses, not for their services in selling the bonds, nor\\nin assuming risks, but for securing others to sell the bonds and\\nincur risks. Thus when the Interboro Railway--a most prosperous\\ncorporation--financed its recent $170,000,000 bond issue, J.\\xa0P.\\nMorgan & Co. received a 3 per cent. commission, that is, $5,100,000,\\npractically for arranging that others should underwrite and sell the\\nbonds.\\n\\nThe aggregate commissions or profits so taken by leading banking houses\\ncan only be conjectured, as the full amount of their transactions\\nhas not been disclosed, and the rate of commission or profit varies\\nvery widely. But the Pujo Committee has supplied some interesting\\ndata bearing upon the subject: Counting the issues of securities of\\ninterstate corporations only, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. directly procured the\\npublic marketing alone or in conjunction with others during the years\\n1902–1912, of $1,950,000,000. What the average commission or profit\\ntaken by J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. was we do not know; but we do know that\\nevery one per cent. on that sum yields $19,500,000. Yet even that huge\\naggregate of $1,950,000,000 includes only a part of the securities\\non which commissions or profits were paid. It does not include any\\nissue of an intrastate corporation. It does not include any securities\\nprivately marketed. It does not include any government, state or\\nmunicipal bonds.\\n\\nIt is to exactions such as these that the wealth of the investment\\nbanker is in large part due. And since this wealth is an important\\nfactor in the creation of the power exercised by the Money Trust, we\\nmust endeavor to put an end to this improper wealth getting, as well\\nas to improper combination. The Money Trust is so powerful and so\\nfirmly entrenched, that each of the sources of its undue power must be\\neffectually stopped, if we would attain the New Freedom.\\n\\n\\nHOW SHALL EXCESSIVE CHARGES BE STOPPED?\\n\\nThe Pujo Committee recommends, as a remedy for such excessive charges,\\nthat interstate corporations be prohibited from entering into any\\nagreements creating a sole fiscal agent to dispose of their security\\nissues; that the issue of the securities of interstate railroads be\\nplaced under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission;\\nand that their securities should be disposed of only upon public or\\nprivate competitive bids, or under regulations to be prescribed by the\\nCommission with full powers of investigation that will discover and\\npunish combinations which prevent competition in bidding. Some of the\\nstate public-service commissions now exercise such power; and it may\\npossibly be wise to confer this power upon the interstate commission,\\nalthough the recommendation of the Hadley Railroad Securities\\nCommission are to the contrary. But the official regulation as proposed\\nby the Pujo Committee would be confined to railroad corporations; and\\nthe new security issues of other corporations listed on the New York\\nStock Exchange have aggregated in the last five years $4,525,404,025,\\nwhich is more than either the railroad or the municipal issues.\\nPublicity offers, however, another and even more promising remedy: a\\nmethod of regulating bankers’ charges which would apply automatically\\nto railroad, public-service and industrial corporations alike.\\n\\nThe question may be asked: Why have these excessive charges been\\nsubmitted to? Corporations, which in the first instance bear\\nthe charges for capital, have, doubtless, submitted because of\\nbanker-control; exercised directly through interlocking directorates,\\nor kindred relations, and indirectly through combinations among bankers\\nto suppress competition. But why have the investors submitted, since\\nultimately all these charges are borne by the investors, except so far\\nas corporations succeed in shifting the burden upon the community? The\\nlarge army of small investors, constituting a substantial majority\\nof all security buyers, are entirely free from banker control. Their\\nsubmission is undoubtedly due, in part, to the fact that the bankers\\ncontrol the avenues to recognizedly safe investments almost as fully\\nas they do the avenues to capital. But the investor’s servility is due\\npartly, also, to his ignorance of the facts. Is it not probable that,\\nif each investor knew the extent to which the security he buys from the\\nbanker is diluted by excessive underwritings, commissions and profits,\\nthere would be a strike of capital against these unjust exactions?\\n\\n\\nTHE STRIKE OF CAPITAL\\n\\nA recent British experience supports this view. In a brief period last\\nspring nine different issues, aggregating $135,840,000, were offered\\nby syndicates on the London market, and on the average only about 10\\nper cent. of these loans was taken by the public. Money was “tight,”\\nbut the rates of interest offered were very liberal, and no one doubted\\nthat the investors were well supplied with funds. _The London Daily\\nMail_ presented an explanation:\\n\\n  “The long series of rebuffs to new loans at the hands of investors\\n  reached a climax in the ill success of the great Rothschild issue.\\n  It will remain a topic of financial discussion for many days, and\\n  many in the city are expressing the opinion that it may have a\\n  revolutionary effect upon the present system of loan issuing and\\n  underwriting. The question being discussed is that the public\\n  have become loth to subscribe for stock which they believe the\\n  underwriters can afford, by reason of the commission they receive,\\n  to sell subsequently at a lower price than the issue price, and\\n  that the Stock Exchange has begun to realize the public’s attitude.\\n  The public sees in the underwriter not so much one who insures\\n  that the loan shall be subscribed in return for its commission as a\\n  middleman, who, as it were, has an opportunity of obtaining stock\\n  at a lower price than the public in order that he may pass it off\\n  at a profit subsequently. They prefer not to subscribe, but to\\n  await an opportunity of dividing that profit. They feel that if,\\n  when these issues were made, the stock were offered them at a more\\n  attractive price, there would be less need to pay the underwriters\\n  so high commissions. It is another practical protest, if indirect,\\n  against the existence of the middleman, which protest is one of the\\n  features of present-day finance.”\\n\\n\\nPUBLICITY AS A REMEDY\\n\\nCompel bankers when issuing securities to make public the commissions\\nor profits they are receiving. Let every circular letter, prospectus\\nor advertisement of a bond or stock show clearly what the banker\\nreceived for his middleman-services, and what the bonds and stocks net\\nthe issuing corporation. That is knowledge to which both the existing\\nsecurity holder and the prospective purchaser is fairly entitled. If\\nthe bankers’ compensation is reasonable, considering the skill and\\nrisk involved, there can be no objection to making it known. If it is\\nnot reasonable, the investor will “strike,” as investors seem to have\\ndone recently in England.\\n\\nSuch disclosures of bankers’ commissions or profits is demanded also\\nfor another reason: It will aid the investor in judging of the safety\\nof the investment. In the marketing of securities there are two classes\\nof risks: One is the risk whether the banker (or the corporation)\\nwill find ready purchasers for the bonds or stock at the issue price;\\nthe other whether the investor will get a good article. The maker\\nof the security and the banker are interested chiefly in getting it\\nsold at the issue price. The investor is interested chiefly in buying\\na good article. The small investor relies almost exclusively upon\\nthe banker for his knowledge and judgment as to the quality of the\\nsecurity; and it is this which makes his relation to the banker one of\\nconfidence. But at present, the investment banker occupies a position\\ninconsistent with that relation. The bankers’ compensation should,\\nof course, vary according to the risk _he_ assumes. Where there is\\na large risk that the bonds or stock will not be promptly sold at\\nthe issue price, the underwriting commission (that is the insurance\\npremium) should be correspondingly large. But the banker ought not\\nto be paid more for getting _investors_ to assume a larger risk. In\\npractice the banker gets the higher commission for underwriting the\\nweaker security, on the ground that his own risk is greater. And\\nthe weaker the security, the greater is the banker’s incentive to\\ninduce his customers to relieve him. Now the law should not undertake\\n(except incidentally in connection with railroads and public-service\\ncorporations) to fix bankers’ profits. And it should not seek to\\nprevent investors from making bad bargains. But it is now recognized\\nin the simplest merchandising, that there should be full disclosures.\\nThe archaic doctrine of _caveat emptor_ is vanishing. The law has\\nbegun to require publicity in aid of fair dealing. The Federal Pure\\nFood Law does not guarantee quality or prices; but it helps the buyer\\nto judge of quality by requiring disclosure of ingredients. Among the\\nmost important facts to be learned for determining the real value of a\\nsecurity is the amount of water it contains. And any excessive amount\\npaid to the banker for marketing a security is water. Require a full\\ndisclosure to the investor of the amount of commissions and profits\\npaid; and not only will investors be put on their guard, but bankers’\\ncompensation will tend to adjust itself automatically to what is fair\\nand reasonable. Excessive commissions--this form of unjustly acquired\\nwealth--will in large part cease.\\n\\n\\nREAL DISCLOSURE\\n\\nBut the disclosure must be real. And it must be a disclosure to the\\ninvestor. It will not suffice to require merely the filing of a\\nstatement of facts with the Commissioner of Corporations or with a\\nscore of other officials, federal and state. That would be almost as\\nineffective as if the Pure Food Law required a manufacturer merely to\\ndeposit with the Department a statement of ingredients, instead of\\nrequiring the label to tell the story. Nor would the filing of a full\\nstatement with the Stock Exchange, if incorporated, as provided by the\\nPujo Committee bill, be adequate.\\n\\nTo be effective, knowledge of the facts must be actually brought home\\nto the investor, and this can best be done by requiring the facts to\\nbe stated in good, large type in every notice, circular, letter and\\nadvertisement inviting the investor to purchase. Compliance with this\\nrequirement should also be obligatory, and not something which the\\ninvestor could waive. For the whole public is interested in putting\\nan end to the bankers’ exactions. England undertook, years ago, to\\nprotect its investors against the wiles of promoters, by requiring\\na somewhat similar disclosure; but the British act failed, in large\\nmeasure of its purpose, partly because under it the statement of facts\\nwas filed only with a public official, and partly because the investor\\ncould waive the provision. And the British statute has now been changed\\nin the latter respect.\\n\\n\\nDISCLOSE SYNDICATE PARTICULARS\\n\\nThe required publicity should also include a disclosure of all\\nparticipants in an underwriting. It is a common incident of\\nunderwriting that no member of the syndicate shall sell at less than\\nthe syndicate price for a definite period, unless the syndicate is\\nsooner dissolved. In other words, the bankers make, by agreement,\\nan artificial price. Often the agreement is probably illegal under\\nthe Sherman Anti-Trust Law. This price maintenance is, however, not\\nnecessarily objectionable. It may be entirely consistent with the\\ngeneral welfare, if the facts are made known. But disclosure should\\ninclude a list of those participating in the underwriting so that the\\npublic may not be misled. The investor should know whether his adviser\\nis disinterested.\\n\\nNot long ago a member of a leading banking house was undertaking to\\njustify a commission taken by his firm for floating a now favorite\\npreferred stock of a manufacturing concern. The bankers took for their\\nservices $250,000 in cash, besides one-third of the common stock,\\namounting to about $2,000,000. “Of course,” he said, “that would have\\nbeen too much if we could have kept it all for ourselves; but we\\ncouldn’t. We had to divide up a large part. There were fifty-seven\\nparticipants. Why, we had even to give $10,000 of stock to----(naming\\nthe president of a leading bank in the city where the business was\\nlocated). He might some day have been asked what he thought of the\\nstock. If he had shrugged his shoulders and said he didn’t know, we\\nmight have lost many a customer for the stock. We had to give him\\n$10,000 of the stock to teach him not to shrug his shoulders.”\\n\\nThink of the effectiveness with practical Americans of a statement like\\nthis:\\n\\n  =A.\\xa0B. & Co.=\\n\\n  =Investment Bankers=\\n\\n  =We have today secured substantial control of the successful\\n  machinery business heretofore conducted by ---- at ----, Illinois,\\n  which has been incorporated under the name of the Excelsior\\n  Manufacturing Company with a capital of $10,000,000, of which\\n  $5,000,000 is Preferred and $5,000,000 Common.=\\n\\n  =As we have a large clientele of confiding customers, we were able\\n  to secure from the owners an agreement for marketing the Preferred\\n  stock--we to fix a price which shall net the owners in cash $95 a\\n  share.=\\n\\n  =We offer this excellent stock to you at $100.75 per share. Our own\\n  commission or profit will be only a little over $5.00 per share, or\\n  say, $250,000 cash, besides $1,500,000 of the Common stock, which\\n  we received as a bonus. This cash and stock commission we are to\\n  divide in various proportions with the following participants in\\n  the underwriting syndicate:=\\n\\n    =C.\\xa0D. & Co., New York=\\n    =E.\\xa0F. & Co., Boston=\\n    =L.\\xa0M. & Co., Philadelphia=\\n    =I.\\xa0K. & Co., New York=\\n    =O.\\xa0P. & Co., Chicago=\\n\\nWere such notices common, the investment bankers would “be worthy of\\ntheir hire,” for only reasonable compensation would ordinarily be\\ntaken.\\n\\nFor marketing the preferred stock, as in the case of Excelsior\\nManufacturing Co. referred to above, investment bankers were doubtless\\nessential, and as middlemen they performed a useful service. But they\\nused their strong position to make an excessive charge. There are,\\nhowever, many cases where the banker’s services can be altogether\\ndispensed with; and where that is possible he should be eliminated, not\\nonly for economy’s sake, but to break up financial concentration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nWHERE THE BANKER IS SUPERFLUOUS\\n\\n\\nThe abolition of interlocking directorates will greatly curtail the\\nbankers’ power by putting an end to many improper combinations.\\nPublicity concerning bankers’ commissions, profits and associates, will\\nlend effective aid, particularly by curbing undue exactions. Many of\\nthe specific measures recommended by the Pujo Committee (some of them\\ndealing with technical details) will go far toward correcting corporate\\nand banking abuses; and thus tend to arrest financial concentration.\\nBut the investment banker has, within his legitimate province, acquired\\ncontrol so extensive as to menace the public welfare, even where his\\nbusiness is properly conducted. If the New Freedom is to be attained,\\nevery proper means of lessening that power must be availed of. A simple\\nand effective remedy, which can be widely applied, even without new\\nlegislation, lies near at hand:--Eliminate the banker-middleman where\\nhe is superfluous.\\n\\nToday practically all governments, states and municipalities pay toll\\nto the banker on all bonds sold. Why should they? It is not because the\\nbanker is always needed. It is because the banker controls the only\\navenue through which the investor in bonds and stocks can ordinarily be\\nreached. The banker has become the universal tax gatherer. True, the\\n_pro rata_ of taxes levied by him upon our state and city governments\\nis less than that levied by him upon the corporations. But few states\\nor cities escape payment of some such tax to the banker on every\\nloan it makes. Even where the new issues of bonds are sold at public\\nauction, or to the highest bidder on sealed proposals, the bankers’\\nsyndicates usually secure large blocks of the bonds which are sold\\nto the people at a considerable profit. The middleman, even though\\nunnecessary, collects his tribute.\\n\\nThere is a legitimate field for dealers in state and municipal bonds,\\nas for other merchants. Investors already owning such bonds must have a\\nmedium through which they can sell their holdings. And those states or\\nmunicipalities which lack an established reputation among investors, or\\nwhich must seek more distant markets, need the banker to distribute new\\nissues. But there are many states and cities which have an established\\nreputation and have a home market at hand. These should sell their\\nbonds direct to investors without the intervention of a middleman.\\nAnd as like conditions prevail with some corporations, their bonds\\nand stocks should also be sold direct to the investor. Both financial\\nefficiency and industrial liberty demand that the bankers’ toll be\\nabolished, where that is possible.\\n\\n\\nBANKER AND BROKER\\n\\nThe business of the investment banker must not be confused with\\nthat of the bond and stock broker. The two are often combined; but\\nthe functions are essentially different. The broker performs a very\\nlimited service. He has properly nothing to do with the original\\nissue of securities, nor with their introduction into the market.\\nHe merely negotiates a purchase or sale as agent for another under\\nspecific orders. He exercises no discretion, except in the method of\\nbringing buyer and seller together, or of executing orders. For his\\nhumble service he receives a moderate compensation, a commission,\\nusually one-eighth of one per cent. (12 1/2 cents for each $100) on\\nthe par value of the security sold. The investment banker also is\\na mere middleman. But he is a principal, not an agent. He is also\\na merchant in bonds and stocks. The compensation received for his\\npart in the transaction is in many cases more accurately described\\nas profit than as commission. So far as concerns new issues of\\ngovernment, state and municipal bonds, especially, he acts as merchant,\\nbuying and selling securities on his own behalf; buying commonly at\\nwholesale from the maker and selling at retail to the investors;\\ntaking the merchant’s risk and the merchant’s profits. On purchases\\nof corporate securities the profits are often very large; but even a\\nlarge profit may be entirely proper; for when the banker’s services\\nare needed and are properly performed, they are of great value. On\\npurchases of government, state and municipal securities the profit is\\nusually smaller; but even a very small profit cannot be justified, if\\nunnecessary.\\n\\n\\nHOW THE BANKER CAN SERVE\\n\\nThe banker’s services include three distinct functions, and only three:\\n\\n_First:_ Specifically as expert. The investment banker has the\\nresponsibility of the ordinary retailer to sell only that merchandise\\nwhich is good of its kind. But his responsibility in this respect is\\nunusually heavy, because he deals in an article on which a great\\nmajority of his customers are unable, themselves, to pass intelligent\\njudgment without aid. The purchase by the investor of most corporate\\nsecurities is little better than a gamble, where he fails to get the\\nadvice of some one who has investigated the security thoroughly as the\\nbanker should. For few investors have the time, the facilities, or the\\nability to investigate properly the value of corporate securities.\\n\\n_Second:_ Specifically as distributor. The banker performs an\\nall-important service in providing an outlet for securities.\\nHis connections enable him to reach possible buyers quickly.\\nAnd good-will--that is, possession of the confidence of regular\\ncustomers--enables him to effect sales where the maker of the security\\nmight utterly fail to find a market.\\n\\n_Third:_ Specifically as jobber or retailer. The investment banker,\\nlike other merchants, carries his stock in trade until it can be\\nmarketed. In this he performs a service which is often of great value\\nto the maker. Needed cash is obtained immediately, because the whole\\nissue of securities can thus be disposed of by a single transaction.\\nAnd even where there is not immediate payment, the knowledge that the\\nmoney will be provided when needed is often of paramount importance.\\nBy carrying securities in stock, the banker performs a service also to\\ninvestors, who are thereby enabled to buy securities at such times as\\nthey desire.\\n\\nWhenever makers of securities or investors require all or any of\\nthese three services, the investment banker is needed, and payment of\\ncompensation to him is proper. Where there is no such need, the banker\\nis clearly superfluous. And in respect to the original issue of many\\nof our state and municipal bonds, and of some corporate securities, no\\nsuch need exists.\\n\\n\\nWHERE THE BANKER SERVES NOT\\n\\nIt needs no banker experts in value to tell us that bonds of\\nMassachusetts or New York, of Boston, Philadelphia or Baltimore and\\nof scores of lesser American cities, are safe investments. The basic\\nfinancial facts in regard to such bonds are a part of the common\\nknowledge of many American investors; and, certainly, of most possible\\ninvestors who reside in the particular state or city whose bonds are\\nin question. Where the financial facts are not generally known, they\\nare so simple, that they can be easily summarized and understood by\\nany prospective investor without interpretation by an expert. Bankers\\noften employ, before purchasing securities, their own accountants\\nto verify the statements supplied by the makers of the security, and\\nuse these accountants’ certificates as an aid in selling. States and\\nmunicipalities, the makers of the securities, might for the same\\npurpose employ independent public accountants of high reputation, who\\nwould give their certificates for use in marketing the securities.\\nInvestors could also be assured without banker-aid that the basic\\nlegal conditions are sound. Bankers, before purchasing an issue of\\nsecurities, customarily obtain from their own counsel an opinion as to\\nits legality, which investors are invited to examine. It would answer\\nthe same purpose, if states and municipalities should supplement the\\nopinion of their legal representatives by that of independent counsel\\nof recognized professional standing, who would certify to the legality\\nof the issue.\\n\\nNeither should an investment banker be needed to find investors\\nwilling to take up, in small lots, a new issue of bonds of New York or\\nMassachusetts, of Boston, Philadelphia or Baltimore, or a hundred other\\nAmerican cities. A state or municipality seeking to market direct to\\nthe investor its own bonds would naturally experience, at the outset,\\nsome difficulty in marketing a large issue. And in a newer community,\\nwhere there is little accumulation of unemployed capital, it might be\\nimpossible to find buyers for any large issue. Investors are apt to be\\nconservative; and they have been trained to regard the intervention of\\nthe banker as necessary. The bankers would naturally discourage any\\nattempt of states and cities to dispense with their services. Entrance\\nupon a market, hitherto monopolized by them, would usually have to be\\nstruggled for. But banker-fed investors, as well as others could, in\\ntime, be brought to realize the advantage of avoiding the middleman and\\ndealing directly with responsible borrowers. Governments, like private\\nconcerns, would have to do educational work; but this publicity would\\nbe much less expensive and much more productive than that undertaken by\\nthe bankers. Many investors are already impatient of banker exactions;\\nand eager to deal directly with governmental agencies in whom they\\nhave more confidence. And a great demand could, at once, be developed\\namong smaller investors whom the bankers have been unable to interest,\\nand who now never buy state or municipal bonds. The opening of this\\nnew field would furnish a market, in some respects more desirable and\\ncertainly wider than that now reached by the bankers.\\n\\nNeither do states or cities ordinarily need the services of the\\ninvestment banker to carry their bonds pending distribution to the\\ninvestor. Where there is immediate need for large funds, states and\\ncities--at least the older communities--should be able to raise the\\nmoney temporarily, quite as well as the bankers do now, while awaiting\\ndistribution of their bonds to the investor. Bankers carry the bonds\\nwith other people’s money, not with their own. Why should not cities\\nget the temporary use of other people’s money as well? Bankers have\\nthe preferential use of the deposits in the banks, often because\\nthey control the banks. Free these institutions from banker-control,\\nand no applicant to borrow the people’s money will be received with\\ngreater favor than our large cities. Boston, with its $1,500,000,000\\nof assessed valuation and $78,033,128 net debt, is certainly as good a\\nrisk as even Lee, Higginson & Co. or Kidder, Peabody & Co.\\n\\nBut ordinarily cities do not, or should not, require large sums of\\nmoney at any one time. Such need of large sums does not arise except\\nfrom time to time where maturing loans are to be met, or when some\\nexisting public utility plant is to be taken over from private owners.\\nLarge issues of bonds for any other purpose are usually made in\\nanticipation of future needs, rather than to meet present necessities.\\nModern efficient public financiering, through substituting serial\\nbonds for the long term issues (which in Massachusetts has been made\\nobligatory) will, in time, remove the need of large sums at one time\\nfor paying maturing debts, since each year’s maturities will be paid\\nfrom the year’s taxes. Purchases of existing public utility plants\\nare of rare occurrence, and are apt to be preceded by long periods\\nof negotiation. When they occur they can, if foresight be exercised,\\nusually be financed without full cash payment at one time.\\n\\nToday, when a large issue of bonds is made, the banker, while\\nostensibly paying his own money to the city, actually pays to the city\\nother people’s money which he has borrowed from the banks. Then the\\nbanks get back, through the city’s deposits, a large part of the money\\nso received. And when the money is returned to the bank, the banker has\\nthe opportunity of borrowing it again for other operations. The process\\nresults in double loss to the city. The city loses by not getting from\\nthe banks as much for its bonds as investors would pay. And then it\\nloses interest on the money raised before it is needed. For the bankers\\nreceive from the city bonds bearing rarely less than 4 per cent.\\ninterest; while the proceeds are deposited in the banks which rarely\\nallow more than 2 per cent. interest on the daily balances.\\n\\n\\nCITIES THAT HELPED THEMSELVES\\n\\nIn the present year some cities have been led by necessity to help\\nthemselves. The bond market was poor. Business was uncertain, money\\ntight and the ordinary investor reluctant. Bankers were loth to take\\nnew bond issues. Municipalities were unwilling to pay the high rates\\ndemanded of them. And many cities were prohibited by law or ordinance\\nfrom paying more than 4 per cent. interest; while good municipal bonds\\nwere then selling on a 4 1/2 to 5 per cent. basis. But money had to be\\nraised, and the attempt was made to borrow it direct from the lenders\\ninstead of from the banker-middleman. Among the cities which raised\\nmoney in this way were Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Paul, and Utica,\\nNew York.\\n\\nPhiladelphia, under Mayor Blankenburg’s inspiration, sold nearly\\n$4,175,000 in about two days on a 4 per cent. basis and another\\n“over-the-counter” sale has been made since. In Baltimore, with the\\nassistance of the _Sun_, $4,766,000 were sold “over the counter” on a\\n4 1/2 per cent. basis. Utica’s two “popular sales” of 4 1/2 per cent.\\nbonds were largely “over-subscribed.” And since then other cities large\\nand small have had their “over-the-counter” bond sales. The experience\\nof Utica, as stated by its Controller, Fred G. Reusswig, must prove of\\ngeneral interest:\\n\\n“In June of the present year I advertised for sale two issues, one of\\n$100,000, and the other of $19,000, bearing interest at 4 1/2 per cent.\\nThe latter issue was purchased at par by a local bidder and of the\\nformer we purchased $10,000 for our sinking funds. That left $90,000\\nunsold, for which there were no bidders, which was the first time that\\nI had been unable to sell our bonds. About this time the ‘popular\\nsales’ of Baltimore and Philadelphia attracted my attention. The laws\\nin effect in those cities did not restrict the officials as does our\\nlaw and I could not copy their methods. I realized that there was\\nplenty of money in this immediate vicinity and if I could devise a plan\\nconforming with our laws under which I could make the sale attractive\\nto small investors it would undoubtedly prove successful. I had found,\\nin previous efforts to interest people of small means, that they did\\nnot understand the meaning of premium and would rather not buy than\\nbid above par. They also objected to making a deposit with their bids.\\nIn arranging for the ‘popular sales’ I announced in the papers that,\\nwhile I must award to the highest bidder, it was my opinion that a par\\nbid would be _the highest bid_. I also announced that we would issue\\nbonds in denominations as low as $100 and that we would not require a\\ndeposit except where the bid was $5,000 or over. Then I succeeded in\\ngetting the local papers to print editorials and local notices upon\\nthe subject of municipal bonds, with particular reference to those\\nof Utica and the forthcoming sale. All the prospective purchaser had\\nto do was to fill in the amount desired, sign his name, seal the bid\\nand await the day for the award. I did not have many bidders for very\\nsmall amounts. There was only one for $100 at the first sale and one\\nfor $100 at the second sale and not more than ten who wanted less than\\n$500. Most of the bidders were looking for from $1,000 to $5,000, but\\nnearly all were people of comparatively small means, and with some\\nthe investment represented all their savings. In awarding the bonds\\nI gave preference to residents of Utica and I had no difficulty in\\napportioning the various maturities in a satisfactory way.\\n\\n“I believe that there are a large number of persons in every city who\\nwould buy their own bonds if the way were made easier by law. Syracuse\\nand the neighboring village of Ilion, both of which had been unable\\nto sell in the usual way, came to me for a program of procedure and\\nboth have since had successful sales along similar lines. We have been\\nable by this means to keep the interest rate on our bonds at 4 1/2 per\\ncent., while cities which have followed the old plan of relying upon\\nbond houses have had to increase the rate to 5 per cent. I am in favor\\nof amending the law in such a manner that the Common Council, approved\\nby the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, may fix the prices at which\\nbonds shall be sold, instead of calling for competitive bids. Then\\nplace the bonds on sale at the Controller’s office to any one who will\\npay the price. The prices upon each issue should be graded according to\\nthe different values of different maturities. Under the present law, as\\nwe have it, conditions are too complicated to make a sale practicable\\nexcept upon a basis of par bids.”\\n\\n\\nTHE ST. PAUL EXPERIMENT\\n\\nSt. Paul wisely introduced into its experiment a more democratic\\nfeature, which Tom L. Johnson, Cleveland’s great mayor, thought\\nout (but did not utilize), and which his friend W.\\xa0B. Colver, now\\nEditor-in-Chief of the _Daily News_, brought to the attention of the\\nSt. Paul officials. Mayor Johnson had recognized the importance of\\nreaching the small savings of the people; and concluded that it was\\nnecessary not only to issue the bonds in very small denominations, but\\nalso to make them redeemable at par. He sought to combine practically,\\nbond investment with the savings bank privilege. The fact that\\nmunicipal bonds are issuable ordinarily only in large denominations,\\nsay, $1,000, presented an obstacle to be overcome. Mayor Johnson’s plan\\nwas to have the sinking fund commissioners take large blocks of the\\nbonds, issue against them certificates in denominations of $10, and\\nhave the commissioners agree (under their power to purchase securities)\\nto buy the certificates back at par and interest. Savings bank\\nexperience, he insisted, showed that the redemption feature would not\\nprove an embarrassment; as the percentage of those wishing to withdraw\\ntheir money is small; and deposits are nearly always far in excess of\\nwithdrawals.\\n\\nThe St. Paul sinking fund commissioners and City Attorney O’Neill\\napproved the Johnson plan; and in the face of high money rates, sold\\non a 4 per cent. basis, during July, certificates to the net amount of\\n$502,300; during August, $147,000; and during September, over $150,000,\\nthe average net sales being about $5,700 a day. Mr. Colver, reporting\\non the St. Paul experience, said:\\n\\n  “There have been about 2,000 individual purchasers making the\\n  average deposit about $350 or $360. There have been no certificates\\n  sold to banks. During the first month the deposits averaged\\n  considerably higher and for this reason: in very many cases people\\n  who had savings which represented the accumulation of considerable\\n  time, withdrew their money from the postal savings banks, from the\\n  regular banks, from various hiding places and deposited them with\\n  the city. Now these same people are coming once or twice a month\\n  and making deposits of ten or twenty dollars, so that the average\\n  of the individual deposit has fallen very rapidly during September\\n  and every indication is that the number of small deposits will\\n  continue to increase and the relatively large deposits become less\\n  frequent as time goes on.\\n\\n  “As a matter of fact, these certificate deposits are stable, far\\n  more than the deposits and investments of richer people who watch\\n  for advantageous reinvestments and who shift their money about\\n  rather freely. The man with three or four hundred dollars savings\\n  will suffer almost anything before he will disturb that fund. We\\n  believe that the deposits every day here, day in and day out, will\\n  continue to take care of all the withdrawals and still leave a net\\n  gain for the day, that net figure at present being about $5,700 a\\n  day.”\\n\\nMany cities are now prevented from selling bonds direct to the small\\ninvestors, through laws which compel bonds to be issued in large\\ndenominations or which require the issue to be offered to the highest\\nbidder. These legislative limitations should be promptly removed.\\n\\n\\nSALESMANSHIP AND EDUCATION\\n\\nSuch success as has already been attained is largely due to the unpaid\\neducational work of leading progressive newspapers. But the educational\\nwork to be done must not be confined to teaching “the people”--the\\nbuyers of the bonds. Municipal officials and legislators have quite as\\nmuch to learn. They must, first of all, study salesmanship. Selling\\nbonds to the people is a new art, still undeveloped. The general\\nproblems have not yet been worked out. And besides these problems\\ncommon to all states and cities, there will be, in nearly every\\ncommunity, local problems which must be solved, and local difficulties\\nwhich must be overcome. The proper solution even of the general\\nproblems must take considerable time. There will have to be many\\nexperiments made; and doubtless there will be many failures. Every\\ngreat distributor of merchandise knows the obstacles which he had to\\novercome before success was attained; and the large sums that had to be\\ninvested in opening and preparing a market. Individual concerns have\\nspent millions in wise publicity; and have ultimately reaped immense\\nprofits when the market was won. Cities must take their lessons from\\nthese great distributors. Cities must be ready to study the problems\\nand to spend prudently for proper publicity work. It might, in the end,\\nprove an economy, even to allow, on particular issues, where necessary,\\na somewhat higher interest rate than bankers would exact, if thereby\\na direct market for bonds could be secured. Future operations would\\nyield large economies. And the obtaining of a direct market for city\\nbonds is growing ever more important, because of the huge increase in\\nloans which must attend the constant expansion of municipal functions.\\nIn 1898 the new municipal issues aggregated $103,084,793; in 1912,\\n$380,810,287.\\n\\n\\nSAVINGS BANKS AS CUSTOMERS\\n\\nIn New York, Massachusetts and the other sixteen states where a\\nsystem of purely mutual savings banks is general, it is possible,\\nwith a little organization, to develop an important market for the\\ndirect purchaser of bonds. The bonds issued by Massachusetts cities\\nand towns have averaged recently about $15,000,000 a year, and those\\nof the state about $3,000,000. The 194 Massachusetts savings banks,\\nwith aggregate assets of $902,105,755.94, held on October 31, 1912,\\n$90,536,581.32 in bonds and notes of states and municipalities. Of this\\nsum about $60,000,000 are invested in bonds and notes of Massachusetts\\ncities and towns, and about $8,000,000 in state issues. The deposits\\nin the savings banks are increasing at the rate of over $30,000,000\\na year. Massachusetts state and municipal bonds have, within a few\\nyears, come to be issued tax exempt in the hands of the holder,\\nwhereas other classes of bonds usually held by savings banks are\\nsubject to a tax of one-half of one per cent. of the market value.\\nMassachusetts savings banks, therefore, will to an increasing extent,\\nselect Massachusetts municipal issues for high-grade bond investments.\\nCertainly Massachusetts cities and towns might, with the coöperation of\\nthe Commonwealth, easily develop a “home market” for “over-the-counter”\\nbond business with the savings banks. And the savings banks of other\\nstates offer similar opportunities to their municipalities.\\n\\n\\nCOÖPERATION\\n\\nBankers obtained their power through combination. Why should not cities\\nand states by means of coöperation free themselves from the bankers?\\nFor by coöperation between the cities and the state, the direct\\nmarketing of municipal bonds could be greatly facilitated.\\n\\nMassachusetts has 33 cities, each with a population of over 12,000\\npersons; 71 towns each with a population of over 5,000; and 250 towns\\neach with a population of less than 5,000. Three hundred and eight of\\nthese municipalities now have funded indebtedness outstanding. The\\naggregate net indebtedness is about $180,000,000. Every year about\\n$15,000,000 of bonds and notes are issued by the Massachusetts cities\\nand towns for the purpose of meeting new requirements and refunding\\nold indebtedness. If these municipalities would coöperate in marketing\\nsecurities, the market for the bonds of each municipality would be\\nwidened; and there would exist also a common market for Massachusetts\\nmunicipal securities which would be usually well supplied, would\\nreceive proper publicity and would attract investors. Successful\\nmerchandising obviously involves carrying an adequate, well-assorted\\nstock. If every city acts alone, in endeavoring to market its bonds\\ndirect, the city’s bond-selling activity will necessarily be sporadic.\\nIts ability to supply the investor will be limited by its own\\nnecessities for money. The market will also be limited to the bonds\\nof the particular municipality. But if a state and its cities should\\ncoöperate, there could be developed a continuous and broad market for\\nthe sale of bonds “over-the-counter.” The joint selling agency of over\\nthree hundred municipalities,--as in Massachusetts--would naturally\\nhave a constant supply of assorted bonds and notes which could be had\\nin as small amounts as the investor might want to buy them. It would\\nbe a simple matter to establish such a joint selling agency by which\\nmunicipalities, under proper regulation of, and aid from the state,\\nwould coöperate.\\n\\nAnd coöperation among the cities and with the state might serve in\\nanother important respect. These 354 Massachusetts municipalities carry\\nin the aggregate large bank balances. Sometimes the balance carried by\\na city represents unexpended revenues; sometimes unexpended proceeds\\nof loans. On these balances they usually receive from the banks 2 per\\ncent. interest. The balances of municipalities vary like those of\\nother depositors; one having idle funds, when another is in need. Why\\nshould not all of these cities and towns coöperate, making, say, the\\nState their common banker, and supply each other with funds as farmers\\nand laborers coöperate through credit-unions? Then cities would get,\\ninstead of 2 per cent. on their balances, all their money was worth.\\n\\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts holds now in its sinking and other\\nfunds nearly $30,000,000 of Massachusetts municipal securities,\\nconstituting nearly three-fourths of all securities held in these\\nfunds. Its annual purchases aggregate nearly $4,000,000. Its purchases\\ndirect from cities and towns have already exceeded $1,000,000 this\\nyear. It would be but a simple extension of the state’s function to\\ncoöperate, as indicated, in a joint, Municipal Bond Selling Agency and\\nCredit Union. It would be a distinct advance in the efficiency of state\\nand municipal financing; and what is even more important, a long step\\ntoward the emancipation of the people from banker-control.\\n\\n\\nCORPORATE SELF-HELP\\n\\nStrong corporations with established reputations, locally or\\nnationally, could emancipate themselves from the banker in a similar\\nmanner. Public-service corporations in some of our leading cities could\\neasily establish “over-the-counter” home markets for their bonds; and\\nwould be greatly aided in this by the supervision now being exercised\\nby some state commissions over the issue of securities by such\\ncorporations. Such corporations would gain thereby not only in freedom\\nfrom banker-control and exactions, but in the winning of valuable local\\nsupport. The investor’s money would be followed by his sympathy. In\\nthings economic, as well as in things political, wisdom and safety lie\\nin direct appeals to the people.\\n\\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad now relies largely upon its stockholders for\\nnew capital. But a corporation with its long-continued success and\\nreputation for stability should have much wider financial support and\\nshould eliminate the banker altogether. With the 2,700 stations on its\\nsystem, the Pennsylvania could, with a slight expense, create nearly\\nas many avenues through which money would be obtainable to meet its\\ngrowing needs.\\n\\n\\nBANKER PROTECTORS\\n\\nIt may be urged that reputations often outlive the conditions which\\njustify them, that outlived reputations are pitfalls to the investors;\\nand that the investment banker is needed to guard him from such\\ndangers. True; but when have the big bankers or their little satellites\\nprotected the people from such pitfalls?\\n\\nWas there ever a more be-bankered railroad than the New Haven? Was\\nthere ever a more banker-led community of investors than New England?\\nSix years before the fall of that great system, the hidden dangers\\nwere pointed out to these banker-experts. Proof was furnished of the\\nrotting timbers. The disaster-breeding policies were laid bare. The\\nbankers took no action. Repeatedly, thereafter, the bankers’ attention\\nwas called to the steady deterioration of the structure. The New Haven\\nbooks disclose 11,481 stockholders who are residents of Massachusetts;\\n5,682 stockholders in Connecticut; 735 in Rhode Island; and 3,510 in\\nNew York. Of the New Haven stockholders 10,474 were women. Of the New\\nHaven stockholders 10,222 were of such modest means that their holdings\\nwere from one to ten shares only. The investors were sorely in need of\\nprotection. The city directories disclose 146 banking houses in Boston,\\n26 in Providence, 33 in New Haven and Hartford, and 357 in New York\\nCity. But who, connected with those New England and New York banking\\nhouses, during the long years which preceded the recent investigation\\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission, raised either voice or pen\\nin protest against the continuous mismanagement of that great trust\\nproperty or warned the public of the impending disaster? Some of the\\nbankers sold their own stock holdings. Some bankers whispered to a\\nfew favored customers advice to dispose of New Haven stock. But not\\none banker joined those who sought to open the eyes of New England\\nto the impending disaster and to avert it by timely measures. New\\nEngland’s leading banking houses were ready to “coöperate” with the\\nNew Haven management in taking generous commissions for marketing the\\nendless supply of new securities; but they did nothing to protect the\\ninvestors. Were these bankers blind? Or were they afraid to oppose the\\nwill of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.?\\n\\nPerhaps it is the banker who, most of all, needs the New Freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nBIG MEN AND LITTLE BUSINESS\\n\\n\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. declare, in their letter to the Pujo Committee,\\nthat “practically all the railroad and industrial development of this\\ncountry has taken place initially through the medium of the great\\nbanking houses.” That statement is entirely unfounded in fact. On the\\ncontrary nearly every such contribution to our comfort and prosperity\\nwas “initiated” _without_ their aid. The “great banking houses” came\\ninto relation with these enterprises, either after success had been\\nattained, or upon “reorganization” after the possibility of success had\\nbeen demonstrated, but the funds of the hardy pioneers, who had risked\\ntheir all, were exhausted.\\n\\nThis is true of our early railroads, of our early street railways, and\\nof the automobile; of the telegraph, the telephone and the wireless; of\\ngas and oil; of harvesting machinery, and of our steel industry; of the\\ntextile, paper and shoe industries; and of nearly every other important\\nbranch of manufacture. The _initiation_ of each of these enterprises\\nmay properly be characterized as “great transactions”; and the men\\nwho contributed the financial aid and business management necessary\\nfor their introduction are entitled to share, equally with inventors,\\nin our gratitude for what has been accomplished. But the instances\\nare extremely rare where the original financing of such enterprises\\nwas undertaken by investment bankers, great or small. It was usually\\ndone by some common business man, accustomed to taking risks; or by\\nsome well-to-do friend of the inventor or pioneer, who was influenced\\nlargely by considerations other than money-getting. Here and there you\\nwill find that banker-aid was given; but usually in those cases it was\\na small local banking concern, not a “great banking house” which helped\\nto “initiate” the undertaking.\\n\\n\\nRAILROADS\\n\\nWe have come to associate the great bankers with railroads. But their\\npart was not conspicuous in the early history of the Eastern railroads;\\nand in the Middle West the experience was, to some extent, similar. The\\nBoston & Maine Railroad owns and leases 2,215 miles of line; but it is\\na composite of about 166 separate railroad companies. The New Haven\\nRailroad owns and leases 1,996 miles of line; but it is a composite of\\n112 separate railroad companies. The necessary capital to build these\\nlittle roads was gathered together, partly through state, county or\\nmunicipal aid; partly from business men or landholders who sought to\\nadvance their special interests; partly from investors; and partly from\\nwell-to-do public-spirited men, who wished to promote the welfare of\\ntheir particular communities. About seventy-five years after the first\\nof these railroads was built, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. became fiscal agent\\nfor all of them by creating the New Haven-Boston & Maine monopoly.\\n\\n\\nSTEAMSHIPS\\n\\nThe history of our steamship lines is similar. In 1807, Robert\\nFulton, with the financial aid of Robert R. Livingston, a judge and\\nstatesman--not a banker--demonstrated with the _Claremont_, that it\\nwas practicable to propel boats by steam. In 1833 the three Cunard\\nbrothers of Halifax and 232 other persons--stockholders of the Quebec\\nand Halifax Steam Navigation Company--joined in supplying about $80,000\\nto build the _Royal William_,--the first steamer to cross the Atlantic.\\nIn 1902, many years after individual enterprises had developed\\npractically all the great ocean lines, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. floated the\\nInternational Mercantile Marine with its $52,744,000 of 4 1/2 bonds,\\nnow selling at about 60, and $100,000,000 of stock (preferred and\\ncommon) on which no dividend has ever been paid. It was just sixty-two\\nyears after the first regular line of transatlantic steamers--The\\nCunard--was founded that Mr. Morgan organized the Shipping Trust.\\n\\n\\nTELEGRAPH\\n\\nThe story of the telegraph is similar. The money for developing\\nMorse’s invention was supplied by his partner and co-worker, Alfred\\nVail. The initial line (from Washington to Baltimore) was built with\\nan appropriation of $30,000 made by Congress in 1843. Sixty-six years\\nlater J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. became bankers for the Western Union through\\nfinancing its purchase by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company.\\n\\n\\nHARVESTING MACHINERY\\n\\nNext to railroads and steamships, harvesting machinery has probably\\nbeen the most potent factor in the development of America; and\\nmost important of the harvesting machines was Cyrus H. McCormick’s\\nreaper. That made it possible to increase the grain harvest twenty-\\nor thirty-fold. No investment banker had any part in introducing this\\ngreat business man’s invention.\\n\\nMcCormick was without means; but William Butler Ogden, a railroad\\nbuilder, ex-Mayor and leading citizen of Chicago, supplied $25,000\\nwith which the first factory was built there in 1847. Fifty-five years\\nlater, J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. performed the service of combining the five\\ngreat harvester companies, and received a commission of $3,000,000.\\nThe concerns then consolidated as the International Harvester Company,\\nwith a capital stock of $120,000,000, had, despite their huge assets\\nand earning power, been previously capitalized, in the aggregate, at\\nonly $10,500,000--strong evidence that in all the preceding years no\\ninvestment banker had financed them. Indeed, McCormick was as able\\nin business as in mechanical invention. Two years after Ogden paid\\nhim $25,000 for a half interest in the business, McCormick bought it\\nback for $50,000; and thereafter, until his death in 1884, no one but\\nmembers of the McCormick family had any interest in the business.\\n\\n\\nTHE BANKER ERA\\n\\nIt may be urged that railroads and steamships, the telegraph and\\nharvesting machinery were introduced before the accumulation of\\ninvestment capital had developed the investment banker, and before\\nAmerica’s “great banking houses” had been established; and that,\\nconsequently, it would be fairer to inquire what services bankers had\\nrendered in connection with later industrial development. The firm of\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. is fifty-five years old; Kuhn, Loeb & Co. fifty-six\\nyears old; Lee, Higginson & Co. over fifty years; and Kidder, Peabody\\n& Co. forty-eight years; and yet the investment banker seems to have\\nhad almost as little part in “initiating” the great improvements of the\\nlast half century, as did bankers in the earlier period.\\n\\n\\nSTEEL\\n\\nThe modern steel industry of America is forty-five years old. The\\n“great bankers” had no part in initiating it. Andrew Carnegie, then\\nalready a man of large means, introduced the Bessemer process in 1868.\\nIn the next thirty years our steel and iron industry increased greatly.\\nBy 1898 we had far outstripped all competitors. America’s production\\nabout equalled the aggregate of England and Germany. We had also\\nreduced costs so much that Europe talked of the “American Peril.” It\\nwas 1898, when J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. took their first step in forming the\\nSteel Trust, by organizing the Federal Steel Company. Then followed\\nthe combination of the tube mills into an $80,000,000 corporation,\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. taking for their syndicate services $20,000,000 of\\ncommon stock. About the same time the consolidation of the bridge and\\nstructural works, the tin plate, the sheet steel, the hoop and other\\nmills followed; and finally, in 1901, the Steel Trust was formed, with\\na capitalization of $1,402,000,000. These combinations came thirty\\nyears after the steel industry had been “initiated”.\\n\\n\\nTHE TELEPHONE\\n\\nThe telephone industry is less than forty years old. It is probably\\nAmerica’s greatest contribution to industrial development. The bankers\\nhad no part in “initiating” it. The glory belongs to a simple,\\nenthusiastic, warm-hearted, business man of Haverhill, Massachusetts,\\nwho was willing to risk _his own_ money. H.\\xa0N. Casson tells of this,\\nmost interestingly, in his “History of the Telephone”:\\n\\n“The only man who had money and dared to stake it on the future of\\nthe telephone was Thomas Sanders, and he did this not mainly for\\nbusiness reasons. Both he and Hubbard were attached to Bell primarily\\nby sentiment, as Bell had removed the blight of dumbness from Sanders’\\nlittle son, and was soon to marry Hubbard’s daughter. Also, Sanders had\\nno expectation, at first, that so much money would be needed. He was\\nnot rich. His entire business, which was that of cutting out soles for\\nshoe manufacturers, was not at any time worth more than thirty-five\\nthousand dollars. Yet, from 1874 to 1878, he had advanced nine-tenths\\nof the money that was spent on the telephone. The first five thousand\\ntelephones, and more, were made with his money. And so many long,\\nexpensive months dragged by before any relief came to Sanders, that\\nhe was compelled, much against his will and his business judgment, to\\nstretch his credit within an inch of the breaking-point to help Bell\\nand the telephone. Desperately he signed note after note until he faced\\na total of one hundred and ten thousand dollars. If the new ‘scientific\\ntoy’ succeeded, which he often doubted, he would be the richest citizen\\nin Haverhill; and if it failed, which he sorely feared, he would be\\na bankrupt. Sanders and Hubbard were leasing telephones two by two,\\nto business men who previously had been using the private lines of\\nthe Western Union Telegraph Company. This great corporation was at\\nthis time their natural and inevitable enemy. It had swallowed most\\nof its competitors, and was reaching out to monopolize all methods of\\ncommunication by wire. The rosiest hope that shone in front of Sanders\\nand Hubbard was that the Western Union might conclude to buy the Bell\\npatents, just as it had already bought many others. In one moment of\\ndiscouragement they had offered the telephone to President Orton, of\\nthe Western Union, for $100,000; and Orton had refused it. ‘What use,’\\nhe asked pleasantly, ‘could this company make of an electrical toy?’\\n\\n“But besides the operation of its own wires, the Western Union was\\nsupplying customers with various kinds of printing-telegraphs and\\ndial-telegraphs, some of which could transmit sixty words a minute.\\nThese accurate instruments, it believed, could never be displaced\\nby such a scientific oddity as the telephone, and it continued to\\nbelieve this until one of its subsidiary companies--the Gold and\\nStock--reported that several of its machines had been superseded by\\ntelephones.\\n\\n“At once the Western Union awoke from its indifference. Even this tiny\\nnibbling at its business must be stopped. It took action quickly,\\nand organized the ‘American Speaking-Telephone Company,’ and with\\n$300,000 capital, and with three electrical inventors, Edison, Gray,\\nand Dolbear, on its staff. With all the bulk of its great wealth\\nand prestige, it swept down upon Bell and his little body-guard. It\\ntrampled upon Bell’s patent with as little concern as an elephant can\\nhave when he tramples upon an ant’s nest. To the complete bewilderment\\nof Bell, it coolly announced that it had the only original telephone,\\nand that it was ready to supply superior telephones with all the latest\\nimprovements made by the original inventors--Dolbear, Gray, and Edison.\\n\\n“The result was strange and unexpected. The Bell group, instead of\\nbeing driven from the field, were at once lifted to a higher level in\\nthe business world. And the Western Union, in the endeavor to protect\\nits private lines, became involuntarily a ‘bell-wether’ to lead\\ncapitalists in the direction of the telephone.”\\n\\nEven then, when financial aid came to the Bell enterprise, it was from\\ncapitalists, not from bankers, and among these capitalists was William\\nH. Forbes (son of the builder of the Burlington) who became the first\\nPresident of the Bell Telephone Company. That was in 1878. More than\\ntwenty years later, after the telephone had spread over the world, the\\ngreat house of Morgan came into financial control of the property.\\nThe American Telephone & Telegraph Company was formed. The process of\\ncombination became active. Since January, 1900, its stock has increased\\nfrom $25,886,300 to $344,606,400. In six years (1906 to 1912), the\\nMorgan associates marketed about $300,000,000 bonds of that company or\\nits subsidiaries. In that period the volume of business done by the\\ntelephone companies had, of course, grown greatly, and the plant had to\\nbe constantly increased; but the proceeds of these huge security issues\\nwere used, to a large extent, in effecting combinations; that is, in\\nbuying out telephone competitors; in buying control of the Western\\nUnion Telegraph Company; and in buying up outstanding stock interests\\nin semi-independent Bell companies. It is these combinations which have\\nled to the investigation of the Telephone Company by the Department of\\nJustice; and they are, in large part, responsible for the movement to\\nhave the government take over the telephone business.\\n\\n\\nELECTRICAL MACHINERY\\n\\nThe business of manufacturing electrical machinery and apparatus\\nis only a little over thirty years old. J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. became\\ninterested early in one branch of it; but their dominance of the\\nbusiness today is due, not to their “initiating” it, but to their\\neffecting a combination, and organizing the General Electric Company\\nin 1892. There were then three large electrical companies, the\\nThomson-Houston, the Edison and the Westinghouse, besides some small\\nones. The Thomson-Houston of Lynn, Massachusetts, was in many respects\\nthe leader, having been formed to introduce, among other things,\\nimportant inventions of Prof. Elihu Thomson and Prof. Houston. Lynn\\nis one of the principal shoe-manufacturing centers of America. It is\\nwithin ten miles of State Street, Boston; but Thomson’s early financial\\nsupport came not from Boston bankers, but mainly from Lynn business\\nmen and investors; men active, energetic, and used to taking risks\\nwith _their own_ money. Prominent among them was Charles A. Coffin,\\na shoe manufacturer, who became connected with the Thomson-Houston\\nCompany upon its organization and president of the General Electric\\nwhen Mr. Morgan formed that company in 1892, by combining the\\nThomson-Houston and the Edison. To his continued service, supported\\nby other Thomson-Houston men in high positions, the great prosperity\\nof the company is, in large part, due. The two companies so combined\\ncontrolled probably one-half of all electrical patents then existing\\nin America; and certainly more than half of those which had any\\nconsiderable value.\\n\\nIn 1896 the General Electric pooled its patents with the Westinghouse,\\nand thus competition was further restricted. In 1903 the General\\nElectric absorbed the Stanley Electric Company, its other large\\ncompetitor; and became the largest manufacturer of electric apparatus\\nand machinery in the world. In 1912 the resources of the Company\\nwere $131,942,144. It billed sales to the amount of $89,182,185. It\\nemployed directly over 60,000 persons,--more than a fourth as many as\\nthe Steel Trust. And it is protected against “undue” competition; for\\none of the Morgan partners has been a director, since 1909, in the\\nWestinghouse,--the only other large electrical machinery company in\\nAmerica.\\n\\n\\nTHE AUTOMOBILE\\n\\nThe automobile industry is about twenty years old. It is now America’s\\nmost prosperous business. When Henry B. Joy, President of the Packard\\nMotor Car Company, was asked to what extent the bankers aided in\\n“initiating” the automobile, he replied:\\n\\n  “It is the observable facts of history, it is also my experience of\\n  thirty years as a business man, banker, etc., that first the seer\\n  conceives an opportunity. He has faith in his almost second sight.\\n  He believes he can do something--develop a business--construct an\\n  industry--build a railroad--or Niagara Falls Power Company,--and\\n  make it pay!\\n\\n  “Now the human measure is not the actual physical construction, but\\n  the ‘make it pay’!\\n\\n  “A man raised the money in the late ’90s and built a beet sugar\\n  factory in Michigan. Wise-acres said it was nonsense. He gathered\\n  together the money from his friends who would take a chance with\\n  him. He not only built the sugar factory (and there was never any\\n  doubt of his ability to do that) but he made it pay. The next\\n  year two more sugar factories were built, and were financially\\n  successful. These were built by private individuals of wealth,\\n  taking chances in the face of cries of doubting bankers and trust\\n  companies.\\n\\n  “Once demonstrated that the industry was a sound one financially\\n  and _then_ bankers and trust companies would lend the new sugar\\n  companies which were speedily organized a large part of the\\n  necessary funds to construct and operate.\\n\\n  “The motor-car business was the same.\\n\\n  “When a few gentlemen followed me in my vision of the possibilities\\n  of the business, the banks and older business men (who in the\\n  main were the banks) said, ‘fools and their money soon to be\\n  parted’--etc., etc.\\n\\n  “Private capital at first establishes an industry, backs it through\\n  its troubles, and, if possible, wins financial success when banks\\n  would not lend a dollar of aid.\\n\\n  “The business once having proved to be practicable and financially\\n  successful, then do the banks lend aid to its needs.”\\n\\nSuch also was the experience of the greatest of the many financial\\nsuccesses in the automobile industry--the Ford Motor Company.\\n\\n\\nHOW BANKERS ARREST DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nBut “great banking houses” have not merely failed to initiate\\nindustrial development; they have definitely arrested development\\nbecause to them the creation of the trusts is largely due. The recital\\nin the Memorial addressed to the President by the Investors’ Guild in\\nNovember, 1911, is significant:\\n\\n  “It is a well-known fact that modern trade combinations tend\\n  strongly toward constancy of process and products, and by their\\n  very nature are opposed to new processes and new products\\n  originated by independent inventors, and hence tend to restrain\\n  competition in the development and sale of patents and patent\\n  rights; and consequently tend to discourage independent inventive\\n  thought, to the great detriment of the nation, and with injustice\\n  to inventors whom the Constitution especially intended to encourage\\n  and protect in their rights.”\\n\\nAnd more specific was the testimony of the _Engineering News_:\\n\\n  “We are today something like five years behind Germany in iron and\\n  steel metallurgy, and such innovations as are being introduced by\\n  our iron and steel manufacturers are most of them merely following\\n  the lead set by foreigners years ago.\\n\\n  “We do not believe this is because American engineers are any\\n  less ingenious or original than those of Europe, though they may\\n  indeed be deficient in training and scientific education compared\\n  with those of Germany. We believe the main cause is the wholesale\\n  consolidation which has taken place in American industry. A huge\\n  organization is too clumsy to take up the development of an\\n  original idea. With the market closely controlled and profits\\n  certain by following standard methods, those who control our trusts\\n  do not want the bother of developing anything new.\\n\\n  “We instance metallurgy only by way of illustration. There are\\n  plenty of other fields of industry where exactly the same condition\\n  exists. We are building the same machines and using the same\\n  methods as a dozen years ago, and the real advances in the art are\\n  being made by European inventors and manufacturers.”\\n\\nTo which President Wilson’s statement may be added:\\n\\n  “I am not saying that all invention had been stopped by the growth\\n  of trusts, but I think it is perfectly clear that invention in many\\n  fields has been discouraged, that inventors have been prevented\\n  from reaping the full fruits of their ingenuity and industry, and\\n  that mankind has been deprived of many comforts and conveniences,\\n  as well as the opportunity of buying at lower prices.\\n\\n  “Do you know, have you had occasion to learn, that there is no\\n  hospitality for invention, now-a-days?”\\n\\n\\nTRUSTS AND FINANCIAL CONCENTRATION\\n\\nThe fact that industrial monopolies arrest development is more\\nserious even than the direct burden imposed through extortionate\\nprices. But the most harm-bearing incident of the trusts is their\\npromotion of financial concentration. Industrial trusts feed the money\\ntrust. Practically every trust created has destroyed the financial\\nindependence of some communities and of many properties; for it has\\ncentered the financing of a large part of whole lines of business in\\nNew York, and this usually with one of a few banking houses. This is\\nwell illustrated by the Steel Trust, which is a trust of trusts; that\\nis, the Steel Trust combines in one huge holding company the trusts\\npreviously formed in the different branches of the steel business.\\nThus the Tube Trust combined 17 tube mills, located in 16 different\\ncities, scattered over 5 states and owned by 13 different companies.\\nThe wire trust combined 19 mills; the sheet steel trust 26; the bridge\\nand structural trust 27; and the tin plate trust 36; all scattered\\nsimilarly over many states. Finally these and other companies were\\nformed into the United States Steel Corporation, combining 228\\ncompanies in all, located in 127 cities and towns, scattered over\\n18 states. Before the combinations were effected, nearly every one\\nof these companies was owned largely by those who managed it, and\\nhad been financed, to a large extent, in the place, or in the state,\\nin which it was located. When the Steel Trust was formed all these\\nconcerns came under one management. Thereafter, the financing of each\\nof these 228 corporations (and some which were later acquired) had to\\nbe done through or with the consent of J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. _That was the\\ngreatest step in financial concentration ever taken._\\n\\n\\nSTOCK EXCHANGE INCIDENTS\\n\\nThe organization of trusts has served in another way to increase the\\npower of the Money Trust. Few of the independent concerns out of\\nwhich the trusts have been formed, were listed on the New York Stock\\nExchange; and few of them had financial offices in New York. Promoters\\nof large corporations, whose stock is to be held by the public, and\\nalso investors, desire to have their securities listed on the New York\\nStock Exchange. Under the rules of the Exchange, no security can be so\\nlisted unless the corporation has a transfer agent and registrar in New\\nYork City. Furthermore, banker-directorships have contributed largely\\nto the establishment of the financial offices of the trusts in New\\nYork City. That alone would tend to financial concentration. But the\\nlisting of the stock enhances the power of the Money Trust in another\\nway. An industrial stock, once listed, frequently becomes the subject\\nof active speculation; and speculation feeds the Money Trust indirectly\\nin many ways. It draws the money of the country to New York. The New\\nYork bankers handle the loans of other people’s money on the Stock\\nExchange; and members of the Stock Exchange receive large amounts from\\ncommissions. For instance: There are 5,084,952 shares of United States\\nSteel common stock outstanding. But in the five years ending December\\n31, 1912, speculation in that stock was so extensive that there were\\nsold on the Exchange an average of 29,380,888 shares a year; or nearly\\nsix times as much as there is Steel common in existence. Except where\\nthe transactions are by or for the brokers, sales on the Exchange\\ninvolve the payment of twenty-five cents in commission for each share\\nof stock sold; that is, twelve and one-half cents by the seller and\\ntwelve and one-half cents by the buyer. Thus the commission from\\nthe Steel common alone afforded a revenue averaging many millions a\\nyear. The Steel preferred stock is also much traded in; and there are\\n138 other industrials, largely trusts, listed on the New York Stock\\nExchange.\\n\\n\\nTRUST RAMIFICATIONS\\n\\nBut the potency of trusts as a factor in financial concentration\\nis manifested in still other ways; notably through their ramifying\\noperations. This is illustrated forcibly by the General Electric\\nCompany’s control of water-power companies which has now been disclosed\\nin an able report of the United States Bureau of Corporations:\\n\\n  “The extent of the General Electric influence is not fully\\n  revealed by its consolidated balance sheet. A very large number of\\n  corporations are connected with it through its subsidiaries and\\n  through corporations controlled by these subsidiaries or affiliated\\n  with them. There is a still wider circle of influence due to the\\n  fact that officers and directors of the General Electric Co. and\\n  its subsidiaries are also officers or directors of many other\\n  corporations, some of whose securities are owned by the General\\n  Electric Company.\\n\\n  “The General Electric Company holds in the first place all the\\n  common stock in three security holding companies: the United\\n  Electric Securities Co., the Electrical Securities Corporation,\\n  and the Electric Bond and Share Co. Directly and through these\\n  corporations and their officers the General Electric controls a\\n  large part of the water power of the United States.\\n\\n  ... “The water-power companies in the General Electric group are\\n  found in 18 States. These 18 States have 2,325,757 commercial\\n  horsepower developed or under construction, and of this total\\n  the General Electric group includes 939,115 h. p. or 40.4 per\\n  cent. The greatest amount of power controlled by the companies in\\n  the General Electric group in any State is found in Washington.\\n  This is followed by New York, Pennsylvania, California, Montana,\\n  Iowa, Oregon, and Colorado. In five of the States shown in the\\n  table the water-power companies included in the General Electric\\n  group control more than 50 per cent. of the commercial power,\\n  developed and under construction. The percentage of power in\\n  the States included in the General Electric group ranges from a\\n  little less than 2 per cent. in Michigan to nearly 80 per cent.\\n  in Pennsylvania. In Colorado they control 72 per cent.; in New\\n  Hampshire 61 per cent.; in Oregon 58 per cent.; and in Washington\\n  55 per cent.\\n\\n  “Besides the power developed and under construction water-power\\n  concerns included in the General Electric group own in the States\\n  shown in the table 641,600 h. p. undeveloped.”\\n\\nThis water power control enables the General Electric group to control\\nother public service corporations:\\n\\n  “The water-power companies subject to General Electric influence\\n  control the street railways in at least 16 cities and towns;\\n  the electric-light plants in 78 cities and towns; gas plants in\\n  19 cities and towns; and are affiliated with the electric light\\n  and gas plants in other towns. Though many of these communities,\\n  particularly those served with light only, are small, several of\\n  them are the most important in the States where these water-power\\n  companies operate. The water-power companies in the General\\n  Electric group own, control, or are closely affiliated with, the\\n  street railways in Portland and Salem, Ore.; Spokane, Wash.; Great\\n  Falls, Mont.; St. Louis, Mo.; Winona, Minn.; Milwaukee and Racine,\\n  Wis.; Elmira, N.\\xa0Y.; Asheville and Raleigh, N.\\xa0C., and other\\n  relatively less important towns. The towns in which the lighting\\n  plants (electric or gas) are owned or controlled include Portland,\\n  Salem, Astoria, and other towns in Oregon; Bellingham and other\\n  towns in Washington; Butte, Great Falls, Bozeman and other towns\\n  in Montana; Leadville and Colorado Springs in Colorado; St. Louis,\\n  Mo.; Milwaukee, Racine and several small towns in Wisconsin; Hudson\\n  and Rensselaer, N.\\xa0Y.; Detroit, Mich.; Asheville and Raleigh,\\n  N.\\xa0C.; and in fact one or more towns in practically every community\\n  where developed water power is controlled by this group. In\\n  addition to the public-service corporations thus controlled by the\\n  water-power companies subject to General Electric influence, there\\n  are numerous public-service corporations in other municipalities\\n  that purchase power from the hydroelectric developments controlled\\n  by or affiliated with the General Electric Co. This is true of\\n  Denver, Colo., which has already been discussed. In Baltimore,\\n  Md., a water-power concern in the General Electric group, namely,\\n  the Pennsylvania Water & Power Co., sells 20,000 h. p. to the\\n  Consolidated Gas, Electric Light & Power Co., which controls the\\n  entire light and power business of that city. The power to operate\\n  all the electric street railway systems of Buffalo, N.\\xa0Y., and\\n  vicinity, involving a trackage of approximately 375 miles, is\\n  supplied through a subsidiary of the Niagara Falls Power Co.”\\n\\nAnd the General Electric Company, through the financing of public\\nservice companies, exercises a like influence in communities where\\nthere is no water power:\\n\\n  “It, or its subsidiaries, has acquired control of or an interest in\\n  the public-service corporations of numerous cities where there is\\n  no water-power connection, and it is affiliated with still others\\n  by virtue of common directors.... This vast network of relationship\\n  between hydro-electric corporations through prominent officers and\\n  directors of the largest manufacturer of electrical machinery and\\n  supplies in the United States is highly significant....\\n\\n  “It is possible that this relationship to such a large number of\\n  strong financial concerns, through common officers and directors,\\n  affords the General Electric Co. an advantage that may place\\n  rivals at a corresponding disadvantage. Whether or not this great\\n  financial power has been used to the particular disadvantage of any\\n  rival water-power concern is not so important as the fact that such\\n  power exists and that it might be so used at any time.”\\n\\n\\nTHE SHERMAN LAW\\n\\nThe Money Trust cannot be broken, if we allow its power to be\\nconstantly augmented. To break the Money Trust, we must stop that power\\nat its source. The industrial trusts are among its most effective\\nfeeders. Those which are illegal should be dissolved. The creation\\nof new ones should be prevented. To this end the Sherman Law should\\nbe supplemented both by providing more efficient judicial machinery,\\nand by creating a commission with administrative functions to aid in\\nenforcing the law. When that is done, another step will have been taken\\ntoward securing the New Freedom. But restrictive legislation alone\\nwill not suffice. We should bear in mind the admonition with which\\nthe Commissioner of Corporations closes his review of our water power\\ndevelopment:\\n\\n“There is ... presented such a situation in water powers and other\\npublic utilities as might bring about at any time under a single\\nmanagement the control of a majority of the developed water power in\\nthe United States and similar control over the public utilities in a\\nvast number of cities and towns, including some of the most important\\nin the country.”\\n\\nWe should conserve all rights which the Federal Government and the\\nStates now have in our natural resources, and there should be a\\ncomplete separation of our industries from railroads and public\\nutilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nA CURSE OF BIGNESS\\n\\n\\nBigness has been an important factor in the rise of the Money Trust:\\nBig railroad systems, Big industrial trusts, Big public service\\ncompanies; and as instruments of these Big banks and Big trust\\ncompanies. J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. (in their letter of defence to the Pujo\\nCommittee) urge the needs of Big Business as the justification for\\nfinancial concentration. They declare that what they euphemistically\\ncall “coöperation” is “simply a further result of the necessity for\\nhandling great transactions”; that “the country obviously requires not\\nonly the larger individual banks, but demands also that those banks\\nshall coöperate to perform efficiently the country’s business”; and\\nthat “a step backward along this line would mean a halt in industrial\\nprogress that would affect every wage-earner from the Atlantic to\\nthe Pacific.” The phrase “great transactions” is used by the bankers\\napparently as meaning large corporate security issues.\\n\\nLeading bankers have undoubtedly coöperated during the last 15 years\\nin floating some very large security issues, as well as many small\\nones. But relatively few large issues were made necessary by great\\nimprovements undertaken or by industrial development. Improvements\\nand development ordinarily proceed slowly. For them, even where the\\nenterprise involves large expenditures, a series of smaller issues is\\nusually more appropriate than single large ones. This is particularly\\ntrue in the East where the building of new railroads has practically\\nceased. The “great” security issues in which bankers have coöperated\\nwere, with relatively few exceptions, made either for the purpose\\nof effecting combinations or as a consequence of such combinations.\\nFurthermore, the combinations which made necessary these large security\\nissues or underwritings were, in most cases, either contrary to\\nexisting statute law, or contrary to laws recommended by the Interstate\\nCommerce Commission, or contrary to the laws of business efficiency.\\nSo both the financial concentration and the combinations which they\\nhave served were, in the main, against the public interest. Size,\\nwe are told, is not a crime. But size may, at least, become noxious\\nby reason of the means through which it was attained or the uses to\\nwhich it is put. And it is size attained by combination, instead of\\nnatural growth, which has contributed so largely to our financial\\nconcentration. Let us examine a few cases:\\n\\n\\nTHE HARRIMAN PACIFICS\\n\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., in urging the “need of large banks and the\\ncoöperation of bankers,” said:\\n\\n“The Attorney-General’s recent approval of the Union Pacific settlement\\ncalls for a single commitment on the part of bankers of $126,000,000.”\\n\\nThis $126,000,000 “commitment” was not made to enable the Union Pacific\\nto secure capital. On the contrary it was a guaranty that it would\\nsucceed in disposing of its Southern Pacific stock to that amount. And\\nwhen it had disposed of that stock, it was confronted with the serious\\nproblem--what to do with the proceeds? This huge underwriting became\\nnecessary solely because the Union Pacific had violated the Sherman\\nLaw. It had acquired that amount of Southern Pacific stock illegally;\\nand the Supreme Court of the United States finally decreed that the\\nillegality cease. This same illegal purchase had been the occasion,\\ntwelve years earlier, of another “great transaction,”--the issue of a\\n$100,000,000 of Union Pacific bonds, which were sold to provide funds\\nfor acquiring this Southern Pacific and other stocks in violation of\\nlaw. Bankers “coöperated” also to accomplish that.\\n\\n\\nUNION PACIFIC IMPROVEMENTS\\n\\nThe Union Pacific and its auxiliary lines (the Oregon Short Line, the\\nOregon Railway and Navigation and the Oregon-Washington Railroad) made,\\nin the fourteen years, ending June 30, 1912, issues of securities\\naggregating $375,158,183 (of which $46,500,000 were refunded or\\nredeemed); but the large security issues served mainly to supply\\nfunds for engaging in illegal combinations or stock speculation. The\\nextraordinary improvements and additions that raised the Union Pacific\\nRailroad to a high state of efficiency were provided mainly by the net\\nearnings from the operation of its railroads. And note how great the\\nimprovements and additions were: Tracks were straightened, grades were\\nlowered, bridges were rebuilt, heavy rails were laid, old equipment\\nwas replaced by new; and the cost of these was charged largely as\\noperating expense. Additional equipment was added, new lines were built\\nor acquired, increasing the system by 3524 miles of line, and still\\nother improvements and betterments were made and charged to capital\\naccount. These expenditures aggregated $191,512,328. But it needed no\\n“large security issues” to provide the capital thus wisely expended.\\nThe net earnings from the operations of these railroads were so large\\nthat nearly all these improvements and additions could have been\\nmade without issuing on the average more than $1,000,000 a year of\\nadditional securities for “new money,” and the company still could have\\npaid six per cent. dividends after 1906 (when that rate was adopted).\\nFor while $13,679,452 a year, on the average, was charged to Cost of\\nRoad and Equipment, the surplus net earnings and other funds would have\\nyielded, on the average, $12,750,982 a year available for improvements\\nand additions, without raising money on new security issues.\\n\\n\\nHOW THE SECURITY PROCEEDS WERE SPENT\\n\\nThe $375,000,000 securities (except to the extent of about $13,000,000\\nrequired for improvements, and the amounts applied for refunding and\\nredemptions) were available to buy stocks and bonds of other companies.\\nAnd some of the stocks so acquired were sold at large profits,\\nproviding further sums to be employed in stock purchases.\\n\\nThe $375,000,000 Union Pacific Lines security issues, therefore, were\\nnot needed to supply funds for Union Pacific improvements; nor did\\nthese issues supply funds for the improvement of any of the companies\\nin which the Union Pacific invested (except that certain amounts were\\nadvanced later to aid in financing the Southern Pacific). _They served,\\nsubstantially, no purpose save to transfer the ownership of railroad\\nstocks from one set of persons to another._\\n\\nHere are some of the principal investments:\\n\\n  1. $91,657,500, in acquiring and financing the Southern Pacific.\\n\\n  2. $89,391,401, in acquiring the Northern Pacific stock and stock\\n        of the Northern Securities Co.\\n\\n  3. $45,466,960, in acquiring Baltimore & Ohio stock.\\n\\n  4. $37,692,256, in acquiring Illinois Central stock.\\n\\n  5. $23,205,679, in acquiring New York Central stock.\\n\\n  6. $10,395,000, in acquiring Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe stock.\\n\\n  7. $8,946,781, in acquiring Chicago & Alton stock.\\n\\n  8. $11,610,187, in acquiring Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul stock.\\n\\n  9. $6,750,423, in acquiring Chicago & Northwestern stock.\\n\\n 10. $6,936,696, in acquiring Railroad Securities Co. stock\\n        (Illinois Central stock.)\\n\\nThe immediate effect of these stock acquisitions, as stated by the\\nInterstate Commerce Commission in 1907, was merely this:\\n\\n“Mr. Harriman may journey by steamship from New York to New Orleans,\\nthence by rail to San Francisco, across the Pacific Ocean to China,\\nand, returning by another route to the United States, may go to Ogden\\nby any one of three rail lines, and thence to Kansas City or Omaha,\\nwithout leaving the deck or platform of a carrier which he controls,\\nand without duplicating any part of his journey.\\n\\n“He has further what appears to be a dominant control in the Illinois\\nCentral Railroad running directly north from the Gulf of Mexico to the\\nGreat Lakes, parallel to the Mississippi River; and two thousand miles\\nwest of the Mississippi he controls the only line of railroad parallel\\nto the Pacific Coast, and running from the Colorado River to the\\nMexican border....\\n\\n“The testimony taken at this hearing shows that about fifty thousand\\nsquare miles of territory in the State of Oregon, surrounded by the\\nlines of the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company, the Oregon Railroad\\nand Navigation Company, and the Southern Pacific Company, is not\\ndeveloped. While the funds of those companies which could be used for\\nthat purpose are being invested in stocks like the New York Central and\\nother lines having only a remote relation to the territory in which\\nthe Union Pacific System is located.”\\n\\nMr. Harriman succeeded in becoming director in 27 railroads with 39,354\\nmiles of line; and they extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific; from\\nthe Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\n\\nTHE AFTERMATH\\n\\nOn September 9, 1909, less than twelve years after Mr. Harriman\\nfirst became a director in the Union Pacific, he died from overwork\\nat the age of 61. But it was not death only that had set a limit to\\nhis achievements. The multiplicity of his interests prevented him\\nfrom performing for his other railroads the great services that had\\nwon him a world-wide reputation as manager and rehabilitator of the\\nUnion Pacific and the Southern Pacific. Within a few months after\\nMr. Harriman’s death the serious equipment scandal on the Illinois\\nCentral became public, culminating in the probable suicide of one\\nof the vice-presidents of that company. The Chicago & Alton (in the\\nmanagement of which Mr. Harriman was prominent from 1899 to 1907, as\\nPresident, Chairman of the Board, or Executive Committeeman), has\\nnever regained the prosperity it enjoyed before he and his associates\\nacquired control. The Père Marquette has passed again into receiver’s\\nhands. Long before Mr. Harriman’s death the Union Pacific had disposed\\nof its Northern Pacific stock, because the Supreme Court of the\\nUnited States declared the Northern Securities Company illegal, and\\ndissolved the Northern Pacific-Great Northern merger. Three years\\nafter his death, the Supreme Court of the United States ordered the\\nUnion Pacific-Southern Pacific merger dissolved. By a strange irony,\\nthe law has permitted the Union Pacific to reap large profits from its\\nillegal transactions in Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific stocks.\\nBut many other stocks held “as investments” have entailed large losses.\\nStocks in the Illinois Central and other companies which cost the Union\\nPacific $129,894,991.72, had on November 15, 1913, a market value of\\nonly $87,851,500; showing a shrinkage of $42,043,491.72 and the average\\nincome from them, while held, was only about 4.30 per cent. on their\\ncost.\\n\\n\\nA BANKERS’ PARADISE\\n\\nKuhn, Loeb & Co. were the Union Pacific bankers. It was in pursuance of\\na promise which Mr. Jacob H. Schiff--the senior partner--had given,\\npending the reorganization, that Mr. Harriman first became a member\\nof the Executive Committee in 1897. Thereafter combinations grew and\\ncrumbled, and there were vicissitudes in stock speculations. But the\\ninvestment bankers prospered amazingly; and financial concentration\\nproceeded without abatement. The bankers and their associates received\\nthe commissions paid for purchasing the stocks which the Supreme Court\\nholds to have been acquired illegally--and have retained them. The\\nbankers received commissions for underwriting the securities issued\\nto raise the money with which to buy the stocks which the Supreme\\nCourt holds to have been illegally acquired, and have retained them.\\nThe bankers received commissions paid for floating securities of the\\ncontrolled companies--while they were thus controlled in violation\\nof law--and have, of course, retained them. Finally when, after\\nyears, a decree is entered to end the illegal combination, these same\\nbankers are on hand to perform the services of undertaker--and receive\\nfurther commissions for their banker-aid in enabling the law-breaking\\ncorporation to end its wrong doing and to comply with the decree of the\\nSupreme Court. And yet, throughout nearly all this long period, both\\nbefore and after Mr. Harriman’s death, two partners in Kuhn, Loeb &\\nCo. were directors or members of the executive committee of the Union\\nPacific; and as such must be deemed responsible with others for the\\nillegal acts.\\n\\nIndeed, these bankers have not only received commissions for the\\nunderwritings of transactions accomplished, though illegal; they\\nhave received commissions also for merely _agreeing_ to underwrite\\na “great transaction” which the authorities would not permit to be\\n_accomplished_. The $126,000,000 underwriting (that “single commitment\\non the part of bankers” to which J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. refer as being\\ncalled for by “the Attorney General’s approval of the Union Pacific\\nsettlement”) never became effective; because the Public Service\\nCommission of California refused to approve the terms of settlement.\\nBut the Union Pacific, nevertheless, paid the Kuhn Loeb Syndicate a\\nlarge underwriting fee for having been ready and willing “to serve,”\\nshould the opportunity arise: and another underwriting commission was\\npaid when the Southern Pacific stock was finally distributed, with the\\napproval of Attorney General McReynolds, under the Court’s decree. Thus\\nthe illegal purchase of Southern Pacific stock yielded directly four\\ncrops of commissions; two when it was acquired, and two when it was\\ndisposed of. And during the intervening period the illegally controlled\\nSouthern Pacific yielded many more commissions to the bankers. For the\\nschedules filed with the Pujo Committee show that Kuhn, Loeb & Co.\\nmarketed, in addition to the Union Pacific securities above referred\\nto, $334,000,000 of Southern Pacific and Central Pacific securities\\nbetween 1903 and 1911.\\n\\nThe aggregate amount of the commissions paid to these bankers in\\nconnection with Union Pacific-Southern Pacific transactions is\\nnot disclosed. It must have been very large; for not only were\\nthe transactions “great”; but the commissions were liberal. The\\nInterstate Commerce Commission finds that bankers received about 5\\nper cent. on the purchase price for buying the first 750,000 shares\\nof Southern Pacific stock; and the underwriting commission on the\\nfirst $100,000,000 Union Pacific bonds issued to make that and other\\npurchases was $5,000,000. How large the two underwriting commissions\\nwere which the Union Pacific paid in effecting the severance of this\\nillegal merger, both the company and the bankers have declined to\\ndisclose. Furthermore the Interstate Commerce Commission showed,\\nclearly, while investigating the Union Pacific’s purchase of the\\nChicago & Alton stock, that the bankers’ profits were by no means\\nconfined to commissions.\\n\\n\\nTHE BURLINGTON\\n\\nSuch railroad combinations produce injury to the public far more\\nserious than the heavy tax of bankers’ commissions and profits. For in\\nnearly every case the absorption into a great system of a theretofore\\nindependent railroad has involved the loss of financial independence\\nto some community, property or men, who thereby become subjects or\\nsatellites of the Money Trust. The passing of the Chicago, Burlington &\\nQuincy, in 1901, to the Morgan associates, presents a striking example\\nof this process.\\n\\nAfter the Union Pacific acquired the Southern Pacific stock in 1901,\\nit sought control, also, of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy,--a\\nmost prosperous railroad, having then 7912 miles of line. The Great\\nNorthern and Northern Pacific recognized that Union Pacific control\\nof the Burlington would exclude them from much of Illinois, Missouri,\\nWisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. The two northern\\nroads, which were already closely allied with each other and with\\nJ.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co., thereupon purchased for $215,227,000, of their\\njoint 4 per cent. bonds, nearly all of the $109,324,000 (par value)\\noutstanding Burlington stock. A struggle with the Union Pacific ensued\\nwhich yielded soon to “harmonious coöperation.” The Northern Securities\\nCompany was formed with $400,000,000 capital, thereby merging the\\nGreat Northern, the Northern Pacific and the Burlington, and joining\\nthe Harriman, Kuhn-Loeb, with the Morgan-Hill interests. Obviously\\nneither the issue of $215,000,000 joint 4’s, nor the issue of the\\n$400,000,000 Northern Securities stock supplied one dollar of funds\\nfor improvements of, or additions to, any of the four great railroad\\nsystems concerned in these “large transactions.” _The sole effect of\\nissuing $615,000,000 of securities was to transfer stock from one set\\nof persons to another._ And the resulting “harmonious coöperation”\\nwas soon interrupted by the government proceedings, which ended with\\nthe dissolution of the Northern Securities Company. But the evil done\\noutlived the combination. The Burlington had passed forever from its\\nindependent Boston owners to the Morgan allies, who remain in control.\\n\\nThe Burlington--one of Boston’s finest achievements--was the creation\\nof John M. Forbes. He was a builder; not a combiner, or banker, or\\nwizard of finance. He was a simple, hard-working business man. He\\nhad been a merchant in China at a time when China’s trade was among\\nAmerica’s big business. He had been connected with shipping and with\\nmanufactures. He had the imagination of the great merchant; the\\npatience and perseverance of the great manufacturer; the courage of\\nthe sea-farer; and the broad view of the statesman. Bold, but never\\nreckless; scrupulously careful of other people’s money, he was ready,\\nafter due weighing of chances, to risk his own in enterprises promising\\nsuccess. He was in the best sense of the term, a great adventurer. Thus\\nequipped, Mr. Forbes entered, in 1852, upon those railroad enterprises\\nwhich later developed into the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. Largely\\nwith his own money and that of friends who confided in him, he built\\nthese railroads and carried them through the panic of ’57, when\\nthe “great banking houses” of those days lacked courage to assume\\nthe burdens of a struggling ill-constructed line, staggering under\\nfinancial difficulties.\\n\\nUnder his wise management, and that of the men whom he trained, the\\nlittle Burlington became a great system. It was “built on honor,” and\\nmanaged honorably. It weathered every other great financial crisis, as\\nit did that of 1857. It reached maturity without a reorganization or\\nthe sacrifice of a single stockholder or bondholder.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nInvestment bankers had no place on the Burlington Board of Directors;\\nnor had the banker-practice, of being on both sides of a bargain.\\n“I am unwilling,” said Mr. Forbes, early in his career, “to run the\\nrisk of having the imputation of buying from a company in which I am\\ninterested.” About twenty years later he made his greatest fight to\\nrescue the Burlington from the control of certain contractor-directors,\\nwhom his biographer, Mr. Pearson, describes as “persons of integrity,\\nwho had conceived that in their twofold capacity as contractors and\\ndirectors they were fully able to deal with themselves justly.” Mr.\\nForbes thought otherwise. The stockholders, whom he had aroused, sided\\nwith him and he won.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nMr. Forbes was the pioneer among Boston railroad-builders. His example\\nand his success inspired many others, for Boston was not lacking then\\nin men who were builders, though some lacked his wisdom, and some his\\ncharacter. Her enterprise and capital constructed, in large part,\\nthe Union Pacific, the Atchison, the Mexican Central, the Wisconsin\\nCentral, and 24 other railroads in the West and South. One by one\\nthese western and southern railroads passed out of Boston control; the\\ngreater part of them into the control of the Morgan allies. Before the\\nBurlington was surrendered, Boston had begun to lose her dominion,\\neven, over the railroads of New England. In 1900 the Boston & Albany\\nwas leased to the New York Central,--a Morgan property; and a few years\\nlater, another Morgan railroad--the New Haven--acquired control of\\nnearly every other transportation line in New England. Now nothing is\\nleft of Boston’s railroad dominion in the West and South, except the\\nEastern Kentucky Railroad--a line 36 miles long; and her control of the\\nrailroads of Massachusetts is limited to the Grafton & Upton with 19\\nmiles of line and the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn,--a passenger road 13\\nmiles long.\\n\\n\\nTHE NEW HAVEN MONOPOLY\\n\\nThe rise of the New Haven Monopoly presents another striking example\\nof combination as a developer of financial concentration; and it\\nillustrates also the use to which “large security issues” are put.\\n\\nIn 1892, when Mr. Morgan entered the New Haven directorate, it was a\\nvery prosperous little railroad with capital liabilities of $25,000,000\\npaying 10 per cent. dividends, and operating 508 miles of line. By\\n1899 the capitalization had grown to $80,477,600, but the aggregate\\nmileage had also grown (mainly through merger or leases of other lines)\\nto 2017. Fourteen years later, in 1913, when Mr. Morgan died and Mr.\\nMellen resigned, the mileage was 1997, just 20 miles less than in 1899;\\nbut the capital liabilities had increased to $425,935,000. Of course\\nthe business of the railroad had grown largely in those fourteen years;\\nthe road-bed was improved, bridges built, additional tracks added, and\\nmuch equipment purchased; and for all this, new capital was needed;\\nand additional issues were needed, also, because the company paid out\\nin dividends more than it earned. But of the capital increase, over\\n$200,000,000 was expended in the acquisition of the stock or other\\nsecurities of some 121 other railroads, steamships, street railway-,\\nelectric-light-, gas- and water-companies. It was these outside\\nproperties, which made necessary the much discussed $67,000,000, 6 per\\ncent. bond issue, as well as other large and expensive security issues.\\nFor in these fourteen years the improvements on the railroad including\\nnew equipment have cost, on the average, only $10,000,000 a year.\\n\\n\\nTHE NEW HAVEN BANKERS\\n\\nFew, if any, of those 121 companies which the New Haven acquired\\nhad, prior to their absorption by it, been financed by J.\\xa0P. Morgan\\n& Co. The needs of the Boston & Maine and Maine Central--the largest\\ngroup--had, for generations, been met mainly through their own\\nstockholders or through Boston banking houses. No investment banker had\\nbeen a member of the Board of Directors of either of those companies.\\nThe New York, Ontario & Western--the next largest of the acquired\\nrailroads--had been financed in New York, but by persons apparently\\nentirely independent of the Morgan allies. The smaller Connecticut\\nrailroads, now combined in the Central New England, had been financed\\nmainly in Connecticut, or by independent New York bankers. The\\nfinancing of the street railway companies had been done largely by\\nindividual financiers, or by small and independent bankers in the\\nstates or cities where the companies operate. Some of the steamship\\ncompanies had been financed by their owners, some through independent\\nbankers. As the result of the absorption of these 121 companies into\\nthe New Haven system, the financing of all these railroads, steamship\\ncompanies, street railways, and other corporations, was made tributary\\nto J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co.; and the independent bankers were eliminated or\\nbecame satellites. _And this financial concentration was proceeded\\nwith, although practically every one of these 121 companies was\\nacquired by the New Haven in violation either of the state or federal\\nlaw, or of both._ Enforcement of the Sherman Act will doubtless result\\nin dissolving this unwieldy illegal combination.\\n\\n\\nTHE COAL MONOPOLY\\n\\nProof of the “coöperation” of the anthracite railroads is furnished by\\nthe ubiquitous presence of George F. Baker on the Board of Directors\\nof the Reading, the Jersey Central, the Lackawanna, the Lehigh,\\nthe Erie, and the New York, Susquehanna & Western railroads, which\\ntogether control nearly all the unmined anthracite as well as the\\nactual tonnage. These roads have been an important factor in the\\ndevelopment of the Money Trust. They are charged by the Department of\\nJustice with fundamental violations both of the Sherman Law and of\\nthe Commodity clause of the Hepburn Act, which prohibits a railroad\\nfrom carrying, in interstate trade, any commodity in which it has an\\ninterest, direct or indirect. Nearly every large issue of securities\\nmade in the last 14 years by any of these railroads (except the Erie),\\nhas been in connection with some act of combination. The combination\\nof the anthracite railroads to suppress the construction, through\\nthe Temple Iron Company, of a competing coal road, has already been\\ndeclared illegal by the Supreme Court of the United States. And in the\\nbituminous coal field--the Kanawha District--the United States Circuit\\nCourt of Appeals has recently decreed that a similar combination by the\\nLake Shore, the Chesapeake & Ohio, and the Hocking Valley, be dissolved.\\n\\n\\nOTHER RAILROAD COMBINATIONS\\n\\nThe cases of the Union Pacific and of the New Haven are typical--not\\nexceptional. Our railroad history presents numerous instances of large\\nsecurity issues made wholly or mainly to effect combinations. Some\\nof these combinations have been proper as a means of securing natural\\nfeeders or extensions of main lines. But far more of them have been\\ndictated by the desire to suppress active or potential competition;\\nor by personal ambition or greed; or by the mistaken belief that\\nefficiency grows with size.\\n\\nThus the monstrous combination of the Rock Island and the St. Louis and\\nSan Francisco with over 14,000 miles of line is recognized now to have\\nbeen obviously inefficient. It was severed voluntarily; but, had it not\\nbeen, must have crumbled soon from inherent defects, if not as a result\\nof proceedings under the Sherman law. Both systems are suffering now\\nfrom the effects of this unwise combination; the Frisco, itself greatly\\novercombined, has paid the penalty in receivership. The Rock Island--a\\nname once expressive of railroad efficiency and stability--has, through\\nits excessive recapitalizations and combinations, become a football of\\nspeculators, and a source of great apprehension to confiding investors.\\nThe combination of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton, and the Père\\nMarquette led to several receiverships.\\n\\nThere are, of course, other combinations which have not been disastrous\\nto the owners of the railroads. But the fact that a railroad\\ncombination has not been disastrous does not necessarily justify it.\\nThe evil of the concentration of power is obvious; and as combination\\nnecessarily involves such concentration of power, the burden of\\njustifying a combination should be placed upon those who seek to effect\\nit.\\n\\nFor instance, what public good has been subserved by allowing the\\nAtlantic Coast Line Railroad Company to issue $50,000,000 of securities\\nto acquire control of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad--a widely\\nextended, self-sufficient system of 5000 miles, which, under the wise\\nmanagement of President Milton H. Smith had prospered continuously for\\nmany years before the acquisition; and which has gross earnings nearly\\ntwice as large as those of the Atlantic Coast Line. The legality of\\nthis combination has been recently challenged by Senator Lea; and an\\ninvestigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission has been ordered.\\n\\n\\nTHE PENNSYLVANIA\\n\\nThe reports from the Pennsylvania suggest the inquiry whether even\\nthis generally well-managed railroad is not suffering from excessive\\nbigness. After 1898 it, too, bought, in large amounts, stocks in\\nother railroads, including the Chesapeake & Ohio, the Baltimore &\\nOhio, and the Norfolk & Western. In 1906 it sold all its Chesapeake\\n& Ohio stock, and a majority of its Baltimore & Ohio and Norfolk &\\nWestern holdings. Later it reversed its policy and resumed stock\\npurchases, acquiring, among others, more Norfolk & Western and New\\nYork, New Haven & Hartford; and on Dec. 31, 1912, held securities\\nvalued at $331,909,154.32; of which, however, a large part represents\\nPennsylvania System securities. These securities (mostly stocks)\\nconstitute about one-third of the total assets of the Pennsylvania\\nRailroad. The income on these securities in 1912 averaged only 4.30\\nper cent. on their valuation, while the Pennsylvania paid 6 per cent.\\non its stock. But the cost of carrying these foreign stocks is not\\nlimited to the difference between this income and outgo. To raise money\\non these stocks the Pennsylvania had to issue its own securities;\\nand there is such a thing as an over-supply even of Pennsylvania\\nsecurities. Over-supply of any stock depresses market values, and\\nincreases the cost to the Pennsylvania of raising new money. Recently\\ncame the welcome announcement of the management that it will dispose\\nof its stocks in the anthracite coal mines; and it is intimated that\\nit will divest itself also of other holdings in companies (like the\\nCambria Steel Company) extraneous to the business of railroading. This\\npolicy should be extended to include the disposition also of all stock\\nin other railroads (like the Norfolk & Western, the Southern Pacific\\nand the New Haven) which are not a part of the Pennsylvania System.\\n\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\nSix years ago the Interstate Commerce Commission, after investigating\\nthe Union Pacific transaction above referred to, recommended\\nlegislation to remedy the evils there disclosed. Upon concluding\\nrecently its investigation of the New Haven, the Commission repeated\\nand amplified those recommendations, saying:\\n\\n“No student of the railroad problem can doubt that a most prolific\\nsource of financial disaster and complication to railroads in the\\npast has been the desire and ability of railroad managers to engage\\nin enterprises outside the legitimate operation of their railroads,\\nespecially by the acquisition of other railroads and their securities.\\nThe evil which results, first, to the investing public, and, finally,\\nto the general public, cannot be corrected after the transaction\\nhas taken place; it can be easily and effectively prohibited. In\\nour opinion the following propositions lie at the foundation of all\\nadequate regulation of interstate railroads:\\n\\n1. Every interstate railroad should be prohibited from spending money\\nor incurring liability or acquiring property not in the operation\\nof its railroad or in the legitimate improvement, extension, or\\ndevelopment of that railroad.\\n\\n2. No interstate railroad should be permitted to lease or purchase any\\nother railroad, nor to acquire the stocks or securities of any other\\nrailroad, nor to guarantee the same, directly or indirectly, without\\nthe approval of the federal government.\\n\\n3. No stocks or bonds should be issued by an interstate railroad except\\nfor the purposes sanctioned in the two preceding paragraphs, and none\\nshould be issued without the approval of the federal government.\\n\\nIt may be unwise to attempt to specify the price at which and the\\nmanner in which railroad stocks and securities shall be disposed of;\\nbut it is easy and safe to define the purpose for which they may be\\nissued and to confine the expenditure of the money realized to that\\npurpose.”\\n\\nThese recommendations are in substantial accord with those adopted by\\nthe National Association of Railway Commissioners. They should be\\nenacted into law. And they should be supplemented by amendments of the\\nCommodity Clause of the Hepburn Act, so that:\\n\\n1. Railroads will be effectually prohibited from owning stock in\\ncorporations whose products they transport;\\n\\n2. Such corporations will be prohibited from owning important\\nstockholdings in railroads; and\\n\\n3. Holding companies will be prohibited from controlling, as does\\nthe Reading, both a railroad and corporations whose commodities it\\ntransports.\\n\\nIf laws such as these are enacted and duly enforced, we shall be\\nprotected from a recurrence of tragedies like the New Haven, of\\ndomestic scandals like the Chicago and Alton, and of international ones\\nlike the Frisco. We shall also escape from that inefficiency which\\nis attendant upon excessive size. But what is far more important,\\nwe shall, by such legislation, remove a potent factor in financial\\nconcentration. Decentralization will begin. The liberated smaller\\nunits will find no difficulty in financing their needs without bowing\\nthe knee to money lords. And a long step will have been taken toward\\nattainment of the New Freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nTHE FAILURE OF BANKER-MANAGEMENT\\n\\n\\nThere is not one moral, but many, to be drawn from the Decline of the\\nNew Haven and the Fall of Mellen. That history offers texts for many\\nsermons. It illustrates the Evils of Monopoly, the Curse of Bigness,\\nthe Futility of Lying, and the Pitfalls of Law-Breaking. But perhaps\\nthe most impressive lesson that it should teach to investors is the\\nfailure of banker-management.\\n\\n\\nBANKER CONTROL\\n\\nFor years J.\\xa0P. Morgan & Co. were the fiscal agents of the New Haven.\\nFor years Mr. Morgan was _the_ director of the Company. He gave to\\nthat property probably closer personal attention than to any other of\\nhis many interests. Stockholders’ meetings are rarely interesting or\\nimportant; and few indeed must have been the occasions when Mr. Morgan\\nattended any stockholders’ meeting of other companies in which he was\\na director. But it was his habit, when in America, to be present at\\nmeetings of the New Haven. In 1907, when the policy of monopolistic\\nexpansion was first challenged, and again at the meeting in 1909\\n(after Massachusetts had unwisely accorded its sanction to the Boston\\n& Maine merger), Mr. Morgan himself moved the large increases of stock\\nwhich were unanimously voted. Of course, he attended the important\\ndirectors’ meetings. His will was law. President Mellen indicated this\\nin his statement before Interstate Commerce Commissioner Prouty, while\\ndiscussing the New York, Westchester & Boston--the railroad without a\\nterminal in New York, which cost the New Haven $1,500,000 a mile to\\nacquire, and was then costing it, in operating deficits and interest\\ncharges, $100,000 a month to run:\\n\\n“I am in a very embarrassing position, Mr. Commissioner, regarding the\\nNew York, Westchester & Boston. I have never been enthusiastic or at\\nall optimistic of its being a good investment for our company in the\\npresent, or in the immediate future; but people in whom I had greater\\nconfidence than I have in myself thought it was wise and desirable; I\\nyielded my judgment; indeed, I don’t know that it would have made much\\ndifference whether I yielded or not.”\\n\\n\\nTHE BANKERS’ RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\nBankers are credited with being a conservative force in the community.\\nThe tradition lingers that they are preëminently “safe and sane.” And\\nyet, the most grievous fault of this banker-managed railroad has been\\nits financial recklessness--a fault that has already brought heavy\\nlosses to many thousands of small investors throughout New England for\\nwhom bankers are supposed to be natural guardians. In a community where\\nits railroad stocks have for generations been deemed absolutely safe\\ninvestments, the passing of the New Haven and of the Boston & Maine\\ndividends after an unbroken dividend record of generations comes as a\\ndisaster.\\n\\nThis disaster is due mainly to enterprises outside the legitimate\\noperation of these railroads; for no railroad company has equaled the\\nNew Haven in the quantity and extravagance of its outside enterprises.\\nBut it must be remembered, that neither the president of the New Haven\\nnor any other railroad manager could engage in such transactions\\nwithout the sanction of the Board of Directors. It is the directors,\\nnot Mr. Mellen, who should bear the responsibility.\\n\\nClose scrutiny of the transactions discloses no justification. On the\\ncontrary, scrutiny serves only to make more clear the gravity of the\\nerrors committed. Not merely were recklessly extravagant acquisitions\\nmade in mad pursuit of monopoly; but the financial judgment, the\\nfinanciering itself, was conspicuously bad. To pay for property several\\ntimes what it is worth, to engage in grossly unwise enterprises, are\\nerrors of which no conservative directors should be found guilty;\\nfor perhaps the most important function of directors is to test\\nthe conclusions and curb by calm counsel the excessive zeal of too\\nambitious managers. But while we have no right to expect from bankers\\nexceptionally good judgment in ordinary business matters; we do have\\na right to expect from them prudence, reasonably good financiering,\\nand insistence upon straightforward accounting. And it is just the\\nlack of these qualities in the New Haven management to which the\\nsevere criticism of the Interstate Commerce Commission is particularly\\ndirected.\\n\\nCommissioner Prouty calls attention to the vast increase of\\ncapitalization. During the nine years beginning July 1, 1903, the\\ncapital of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company\\nitself increased from $93,000,000 to about $417,000,000 (excluding\\npremiums). That fact alone would not convict the management of\\nreckless financiering; but the fact that so little of the new capital\\nwas represented by stock might well raise a question as to its\\nconservativeness. For the indebtedness (including guaranties) was\\nincreased over twenty times (from about $14,000,000 to $300,000,000),\\nwhile the stock outstanding in the hands of the public was not doubled\\n($80,000,000 to $158,000,000). Still, in these days of large things,\\neven such growth of corporate liabilities might be consistent with\\n“safe and sane management.”\\n\\nBut what can be said in defense of the financial judgment of the\\nbanker-management under which these two railroads find themselves\\nconfronted, in the fateful year 1913, with a most disquieting floating\\nindebtedness? On March 31, the New Haven had outstanding $43,000,000 in\\nshort-time notes; the Boston & Maine had then outstanding $24,500,000,\\nwhich have been increased since to $27,000,000; and additional notes\\nhave been issued by several of its subsidiary lines. Mainly to meet its\\nshare of these loans, the New Haven, which before its great expansion\\ncould sell at par 3 1/2 per cent. bonds convertible into stock at\\n$150 a share, was so eager to issue at par $67,500,000 of its 6 per\\ncent. 20-year bonds convertible into stock as to agree to pay J.\\xa0P.\\nMorgan & Co. a 2 1/2 per cent. underwriting commission. True, money was\\n“tight” then. But is it not very bad financiering to be so unprepared\\nfor the “tight” money market which had been long expected? Indeed, the\\nNew Haven’s management, particularly, ought to have avoided such an\\nerror; for it committed a similar one in the “tight” money market of\\n1907–1908, when it had to sell at par $39,000,000 of its 6 per cent.\\n40-year bonds.\\n\\nThese huge short-time borrowings of the System were not due to\\nunexpected emergencies or to their monetary conditions. They were of\\ngradual growth. On June 30, 1910, the two companies owed in short-term\\nnotes only $10,180,364; by June 30, 1911, the amount had grown to\\n$30,759,959; by June 30, 1912, to $45,395,000; and in 1913 to over\\n$70,000,000. Of course the rate of interest on the loans increased\\nalso very largely. And these loans were incurred unnecessarily. They\\nrepresent, in the main, not improvements on the New Haven or on the\\nBoston & Maine Railroads, but money borrowed either to pay for stocks\\nin other companies which these companies could not afford to buy, or\\nto pay dividends which had not been earned.\\n\\nIn five years out of the last six the New Haven Railroad has, on its\\nown showing, paid dividends in excess of the year’s earnings; and the\\nannual deficits disclosed would have been much larger if proper charges\\nfor depreciation of equipment and of steamships had been made. In\\neach of the last three years, during which the New Haven had absolute\\ncontrol of the Boston & Maine, the latter paid out in dividends so much\\nin excess of earnings that before April, 1913, the surplus accumulated\\nin earlier years had been converted into a deficit.\\n\\nSurely these facts show, at least, an extraordinary lack of financial\\nprudence.\\n\\n\\nWHY BANKER-MANAGEMENT FAILED\\n\\nNow, how can the failure of the banker-management of the New Haven be\\nexplained?\\n\\nA few have questioned the ability; a few the integrity of the bankers.\\nCommissioner Prouty attributed the mistakes made to the Company’s\\npursuit of a transportation monopoly.\\n\\n“The reason,” says he, “is as apparent as the fact itself. The present\\nmanagement of that Company started out with the purpose of controlling\\nthe transportation facilities of New England. In the accomplishment of\\nthat purpose it bought what must be had and paid what must be paid. To\\nthis purpose and its attempted execution can be traced every one of\\nthese financial misfortunes and derelictions.”\\n\\nBut it still remains to find the cause of the bad judgment exercised\\nby the eminent banker-management in entering upon and in carrying out\\nthe policy of monopoly. For there were as grave errors in the execution\\nof the policy of monopoly as in its adoption. Indeed, it was the\\naggregation of important errors of detail which compelled first the\\nreduction, then the passing of dividends and which ultimately impaired\\nthe Company’s credit.\\n\\nThe failure of the banker-management of the New Haven cannot be\\nexplained as the shortcomings of individuals. The failure was not\\naccidental. It was not exceptional. It was the natural result of\\nconfusing the functions of banker and business man.\\n\\n\\nUNDIVIDED LOYALTY\\n\\nThe banker should be detached from the business for which he performs\\nthe banking service. This detachment is desirable, in the first\\nplace, in order to avoid conflict of interest. The relation of\\nbanker-directors to corporations which they finance has been a subject\\nof just criticism. Their conflicting interests necessarily prevent\\nsingle-minded devotion to the corporation. When a banker-director of a\\nrailroad decides as railroad man that it shall issue securities, and\\nthen sells them to himself as banker, fixing the price at which they\\nare to be taken, there is necessarily grave danger that the interests\\nof the railroad may suffer--suffer both through issuing of securities\\nwhich ought not to be issued, and from selling them at a price less\\nfavorable to the company than should have been obtained. For it is\\nordinarily impossible for a banker-director to judge impartially\\nbetween the corporation and himself. Even if he succeeded in being\\nimpartial, the relation would not conduce to the best interests of\\nthe company. The best bargains are made when buyer and seller are\\nrepresented by different persons.\\n\\n\\nDETACHMENT AN ESSENTIAL\\n\\nBut the objection to banker-management does not rest wholly, or perhaps\\nmainly, upon the importance of avoiding divided loyalty. A complete\\ndetachment of the banker from the corporation is necessary in order to\\nsecure for the railroad the benefit of the clearest financial judgment;\\nfor the banker’s judgment will be necessarily clouded by participation\\nin the management or by ultimate responsibility for the policy actually\\npursued. It is _outside_ financial advice which the railroad needs.\\n\\nLong ago it was recognized that “a man who is his own lawyer has a\\nfool for a client.” The essential reason for this is that soundness\\nof judgment is easily obscured by self-interest. Similarly, it is not\\nthe proper function of the banker to construct, purchase, or operate\\nrailroads, or to engage in industrial enterprises. The proper function\\nof the banker is to give to or to withhold credit from other concerns;\\nto purchase or to refuse to purchase securities from other concerns;\\nand to sell securities to other customers. The proper exercise of\\nthis function demands that the banker should be wholly detached from\\nthe concern whose credit or securities are under consideration.\\nHis decision to grant or to withhold credit, to purchase or not to\\npurchase securities, involves passing judgment on the efficiency of\\nthe management or the soundness of the enterprise; and he ought not\\nto occupy a position where in so doing he is passing judgment on\\nhimself. Of course detachment does not imply lack of knowledge. The\\nbanker should act only with full knowledge, just as a lawyer should act\\nonly with full knowledge. The banker who undertakes to make loans to\\nor purchase securities from a railroad for sale to his other customers\\nought to have as full knowledge of its affairs as does its legal\\nadviser. But the banker should not be, in any sense, his own client. He\\nshould not, in the capacity of banker, pass judgment upon the wisdom of\\nhis own plans or acts as railroad man.\\n\\nSuch a detached attitude on the part of the banker is demanded also\\nin the interest of his other customers--the purchasers of corporate\\nsecurities. The investment banker stands toward a large part of his\\ncustomers in a position of trust, which should be fully recognized.\\nThe small investors, particularly the women, who are holding an\\never-increasing proportion of our corporate securities, commonly\\nbuy on the recommendation of their bankers. The small investors do\\nnot, and in most cases cannot, ascertain for themselves the facts on\\nwhich to base a proper judgment as to the soundness of securities\\noffered. And even if these investors were furnished with the facts,\\nthey lack the business experience essential to forming a proper\\njudgment. Such investors need and are entitled to have the bankers’\\nadvice, and obviously their unbiased advice; and the advice cannot be\\nunbiased where the banker, as part of the corporation’s management, has\\nparticipated in the creation of the securities which are the subject of\\nsale to the investor.\\n\\nIs it conceivable that the great house of Morgan would have aided in\\nproviding the New Haven with the hundreds of millions so unwisely\\nexpended, if its judgment had not been clouded by participation in the\\nNew Haven’s management?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTHE INEFFICIENCY OF THE OLIGARCHS\\n\\n\\nWe must break the Money Trust or the Money Trust will break us.\\n\\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission said in its report on the most\\ndisastrous of the recent wrecks on the New Haven Railroad:\\n\\n  “On this directorate were and are men whom the confiding public\\n  recognize as magicians in the art of finance, and wizards in\\n  the construction, operation, and consolidation of great systems\\n  of railroads. The public therefore rested secure that with the\\n  knowledge of the railroad art possessed by such men investments and\\n  travel should both be safe. Experience has shown that this reliance\\n  of the public was not justified as to either finance or safety.”\\n\\nThis failure of banker-management is not surprising. The surprise is\\nthat men should have supposed it would succeed. For banker-management\\ncontravenes the fundamental laws of human limitations: _First_, that\\nno man can serve two masters; _second_, that a man cannot at the same\\ntime do many things well.\\n\\n\\nSEEMING SUCCESSES\\n\\nThere are numerous seeming exceptions to these rules; and a relatively\\nfew real ones. Of course, many banker-managed properties have been\\nprosperous; some for a long time, at the expense of the public; some\\nfor a shorter time, because of the impetus attained before they were\\nbanker-managed. It is not difficult to have a large net income,\\nwhere one has the field to oneself, has all the advantages privilege\\ncan give, and may “charge all the traffic will bear.” And even in\\ncompetitive business the success of a long-established, well-organized\\nbusiness with a widely extended good-will, must continue for a\\nconsiderable time; especially if buttressed by intertwined relations\\nconstantly giving it the preference over competitors. The real test of\\nefficiency comes when success has to be struggled for; when natural\\nor legal conditions limit the charges which may be made for the goods\\nsold or service rendered. Our banker-managed railroads have recently\\nbeen subjected to such a test, and they have failed to pass it. “It is\\nonly,” says Goethe, “when working within limitations, that the master\\nis disclosed.”\\n\\n\\nWHY OLIGARCHY FAILS\\n\\nBanker-management fails, partly because the private interest destroys\\nsoundness of judgment and undermines loyalty. It fails partly, also,\\nbecause banker directors are led by their occupation (and often\\neven by the mere fact of their location remote from the operated\\nproperties) to apply a false test in making their decisions. Prominent\\nin the banker-director mind is always this thought: “What will be the\\nprobable effect of our action upon the market value of the company’s\\nstock and bonds, or, indeed, generally upon stock exchange values?”\\nThe stock market is so much a part of the investment-banker’s life,\\nthat he cannot help being affected by this consideration, however\\ndisinterested he may be. The stock market is sensitive. Facts are\\noften misinterpreted “by the street” or by investors. And with the\\nbest of intentions, directors susceptible to such influences are led\\nto unwise decisions in the effort to prevent misinterpretations. Thus,\\nexpenditures necessary for maintenance, or for the ultimate good of\\na property are often deferred by banker-directors, because of the\\nbelief that the making of them _now_, would (by showing smaller net\\nearnings), create a bad, and even false, impression on the market.\\nDividends are paid which should not be, because of the effect which it\\nis believed reduction or suspension would have upon the market value of\\nthe company’s securities. To exercise a sound judgment in the difficult\\naffairs of business is, at best, a delicate operation. And no man can\\nsuccessfully perform that function whose mind is diverted, however\\ninnocently, from the study of, “what is best in the long run for the\\ncompany of which I am director?” The banker-director is peculiarly\\nliable to such distortion of judgment by reason of his occupation\\nand his environment. But there is a further reason why, ordinarily,\\nbanker-management must fail.\\n\\n\\nTHE ELEMENT OF TIME\\n\\nThe banker, with his multiplicity of interests, cannot ordinarily\\ngive the time essential to proper supervision and to acquiring that\\nknowledge of the facts necessary to the exercise of sound judgment. The\\n_Century Dictionary_ tells us that a Director is “one who directs; one\\nwho guides, superintends, governs and manages.” Real efficiency in any\\nbusiness in which conditions are ever changing must ultimately depend,\\nin large measure, upon the correctness of the judgment exercised,\\nalmost from day to day, on the important problems as they arise. And\\nhow can the leading bankers, necessarily engrossed in the problems of\\ntheir own vast private businesses, get time to know and to correlate\\nthe facts concerning so many other complex businesses? Besides, they\\nstart usually with ignorance of the particular business which they are\\nsupposed to direct. When the last paper was signed which created the\\nSteel Trust, one of the lawyers (as Mr. Perkins frankly tells us) said:\\n“That signature is the last one necessary to put the Steel industry, on\\na large scale, into the hands of men who do not know anything about it.”\\n\\n\\nAVOCATIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS\\n\\nThe New Haven System is not a railroad, but an agglomeration of a\\nrailroad plus 121 separate corporations, control of which was acquired\\nby the New Haven after that railroad attained its full growth of\\nabout 2000 miles of line. In administering the railroad and each of\\nthe properties formerly managed through these 122 separate companies,\\nthere must arise from time to time difficult questions on which the\\ndirectors should pass judgment. The real managing directors of the\\nNew Haven system during the decade of its decline were: J. Pierpont\\nMorgan, George F. Baker, and William Rockefeller. Mr. Morgan was, until\\nhis death in 1913, the head of perhaps the largest banking house in\\nthe world. Mr. Baker was, until 1909, President and then Chairman of\\nthe Board of Directors of one of America’s leading banks (the First\\nNational of New York), and Mr. Rockefeller was, until 1911, President\\nof the Standard Oil Company. Each was well advanced in years. Yet\\neach of these men, besides the duties of his own vast business, and\\nimportant private interests, undertook to “guide, superintend, govern\\nand manage,” not only the New Haven but also the following other\\ncorporations, some of which were similarly complex: Mr. Morgan, 48\\ncorporations, including 40 railroad corporations, with at least 100\\nsubsidiary companies, and 16,000 miles of line; 3 banks and trust or\\ninsurance companies; 5 industrial and public-service companies. Mr.\\nBaker, 48 corporations, including 15 railroad corporations, with at\\nleast 158 subsidiaries, and 37,400 miles of track; 18 banks, and trust\\nor insurance companies; 15 public-service corporations and industrial\\nconcerns. Mr. Rockefeller, 37 corporations, including 23 railroad\\ncorporations with at least 117 subsidiary companies, and 26,400 miles\\nof line; 5 banks, trust or insurance companies; 9 public service\\ncompanies and industrial concerns.\\n\\n\\nSUBSTITUTES\\n\\nIt has been urged that in view of the heavy burdens which the leaders\\nof finance assume in directing Business-America, we should be patient\\nof error and refrain from criticism, lest the leaders be deterred from\\ncontinuing to perform this public service. A very respectable Boston\\ndaily said a few days after Commissioner McChord’s report on the North\\nHaven wreck:\\n\\n  “It is believed that the New Haven pillory repeated with some\\n  frequency will make the part of railroad director quite undesirable\\n  and hard to fill, and more and more avoided by responsible men.\\n  Indeed it may even become so that men will have to be paid a\\n  substantial salary to compensate them in some degree for the risk\\n  involved in being on the board of directors.”\\n\\nBut there is no occasion for alarm. The American people have as little\\nneed of oligarchy in business as in politics. There are thousands of\\nmen in America who could have performed for the New Haven stockholders\\nthe task of one “who guides, superintends, governs and manages,”\\nbetter than did Mr. Morgan, Mr. Baker and Mr. Rockefeller. For though\\npossessing less native ability, even the average business man would\\nhave done better than they, because working under proper conditions.\\nThere is great strength in serving with singleness of purpose one\\nmaster only. There is great strength in having time to give to a\\nbusiness the attention which its difficult problems demand. And tens\\nof thousands more Americans could be rendered competent to guide our\\nimportant businesses. Liberty is the greatest developer. Herodotus\\ntells us that while the tyrants ruled, the Athenians were no better\\nfighters than their neighbors; but when freed, they immediately\\nsurpassed all others. If industrial democracy--true coöperation--should\\nbe substituted for industrial absolutism, there would be no lack of\\nindustrial leaders.\\n\\n\\nENGLAND’S BIG BUSINESS\\n\\nEngland, too, has big business. But her big business is the Coöperative\\nWholesale Society, with a wonderful story of 50 years of beneficent\\ngrowth. Its annual turnover is now about $150,000,000--an amount\\nexceeded by the sales of only a few American industrials; an amount\\nlarger than the gross receipts of any American railroad, except the\\nPennsylvania and the New York Central systems. Its business is very\\ndiversified, for its purpose is to supply the needs of its members.\\nIt includes that of wholesale dealer, of manufacturer, of grower, of\\nminer, of banker, of insurer and of carrier. It operates the biggest\\nflour mills and the biggest shoe factory in all Great Britain. It\\nmanufactures woolen cloths, all kinds of men’s, women’s and children’s\\nclothing, a dozen kinds of prepared foods, and as many household\\narticles. It operates creameries. It carries on every branch of the\\nprinting business. It is now buying coal lands. It has a bacon factory\\nin Denmark, and a tallow and oil factory in Australia. It grows tea in\\nCeylon. And through all the purchasing done by the Society runs this\\ngeneral principle: Go direct to the source of production, whether at\\nhome or abroad, so as to save commissions of middlemen and agents.\\nAccordingly, it has buyers and warehouses in the United States, Canada,\\nAustralia, Spain, Denmark and Sweden. It owns steamers plying between\\nContinental and English ports. It has an important banking department;\\nit insures the property and person of its members. Every one of these\\ndepartments is conducted in competition with the most efficient\\nconcerns in their respective lines in Great Britain. The Coöperative\\nWholesale Society makes its purchases, and manufactures its products,\\nin order to supply the 1399 local distributive, coöperative societies\\nscattered over all England; but each local society is at liberty to buy\\nfrom the wholesale society, or not, as it chooses; and they buy only if\\nthe Coöperative Wholesale sells at market prices. This the Coöperative\\nactually does; and it is able besides to return to the local a fair\\ndividend on its purchases.\\n\\n\\nINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY\\n\\nNow, how are the directors of this great business chosen? Not by\\nEngland’s leading bankers, or other notabilities, supposed to possess\\nunusual wisdom; but democratically, by all of the people interested in\\nthe operations of the Society. And the number of such persons who have\\ndirectly or indirectly a voice in the selection of the directors of the\\nEnglish Coöperative Wholesale Society is 2,750,000. For the directors\\nof the Wholesale Society are elected by vote of the delegates of the\\n1399 retail societies. And the delegates of the retail societies are,\\nin turn, selected by the members of the local societies;--that is,\\nby the consumers, on the principle of one man, one vote, regardless\\nof the amount of capital contributed. Note what kind of men these\\nindustrial democrats select to exercise executive control of their vast\\norganization. Not all-wise bankers or their dummies, but men who have\\nrisen from the ranks of coöperation; men who, by conspicuous service\\nin the local societies have won the respect and confidence of their\\nfellows. The directors are elected for one year only; but a director\\nis rarely unseated. J.\\xa0T.\\xa0W. Mitchell was president of the Society\\ncontinuously for 21 years. Thirty-two directors are selected in this\\nmanner. Each gives to the business of the Society his whole time and\\nattention; and the aggregate salaries of the thirty-two is less than\\nthat of many a single executive in American corporations; for these\\ndirectors of England’s big business serve each for a salary of about\\n$1500 a year.\\n\\nThe Coöperative Wholesale Society of England is the oldest and largest\\nof these institutions. But similar wholesale societies exist in 15\\nother countries. The Scotch Society (which William Maxwell has served\\nmost efficiently as President for thirty years at a salary never\\nexceeding $38 a week) has a turn-over of more than $50,000,000 a year.\\n\\n\\nA REMEDY FOR TRUSTS\\n\\nAlbert Sonnichsen, General Secretary of the Coöperative League, tells\\nin the _American Review of Reviews_ for April, 1913, how the Swedish\\nWholesale Society curbed the Sugar Trust; how it crushed the Margerine\\nCombine (compelling it to dissolve after having lost 2,300,000 crowns\\nin the struggle); and how in Switzerland the Wholesale Society forced\\nthe dissolution of the Shoe Manufacturers Association. He tells also\\nthis memorable incident:\\n\\n  “Six years ago, at an international congress in Cremona, Dr. Hans\\n  Müller, a Swiss delegate, presented a resolution by which an\\n  international wholesale society should be created. Luigi Luzzatti,\\n  Italian Minister of State and an ardent member of the movement,\\n  was in the chair. Those who were present say Luzzatti paused, his\\n  eyes lighted up, then, dramatically raising his hand, he said: ‘Dr.\\n  Müller proposes to the assembly a great idea--that of opposing\\n  to the great trusts, the Rockefellers of the world, a world-wide\\n  coöperative alliance which shall become so powerful as to crush the\\n  trusts.’”\\n\\n\\nCOÖPERATION IN AMERICA\\n\\nAmerica has no Wholesale Coöperative Society able to grapple with\\nthe trusts. But it has some very strong retail societies, like the\\nTamarack of Michigan, which has distributed in dividends to its members\\n$1,144,000 in 23 years. The recent high cost of living has greatly\\nstimulated interest in the coöperative movement; and John Graham Brooks\\nreports that we have already about 350 local distributive societies.\\nThe movement toward federation is progressing. There are over 100\\ncoöperative stores in Minnesota, Wisconsin and other Northwestern\\nstates, many of which were organized by or through the zealous work of\\nMr. Tousley and his associates of the Right Relationship League and\\nare in some ways affiliated. In New York City 83 organizations are\\naffiliated with the Coöperative League. In New Jersey the societies\\nhave federated into the American Coöperative Alliance of Northern New\\nJersey. In California, long the seat of effective coöperative work, a\\ncentral management committee is developing. And progressive Wisconsin\\nhas recently legislated wisely to develop coöperation throughout the\\nstate.\\n\\nAmong our farmers the interest in coöperation is especially keen.\\nThe federal government has just established a separate bureau of\\nthe Department of Agriculture to aid in the study, development and\\nintroduction of the best methods of coöperation in the working of\\nfarms, in buying, and in distribution; and special attention is\\nnow being given to farm credits--a field of coöperation in which\\nContinental Europe has achieved complete success, and to which David\\nLubin, America’s delegate to the International Institute of Agriculture\\nat Rome, has, among others, done much to direct our attention.\\n\\n\\nPEOPLE’S SAVINGS BANKS\\n\\nThe German farmer has achieved democratic banking. The 13,000 little\\ncoöperative credit associations, with an average membership of about\\n90 persons, are truly banks of the people, by the people and for the\\npeople.\\n\\n_First:_ The banks’ resources are _of_ the people. These aggregate\\nabout $500,000,000. Of this amount $375,000,000 represents the farmers’\\nsavings deposits; $50,000,000, the farmers’ current deposits;\\n$6,000,000, the farmers’ share capital; and $13,000,000, amounts earned\\nand placed in the reserve. Thus, nearly nine-tenths of these large\\nresources belong to the farmers--that is, to the members of the banks.\\n\\n_Second:_ The banks are managed _by_ the people--that is, the members.\\nAnd membership is easily attained; for the average amount of paid-up\\nshare capital was, in 1909, less than $5 per member. Each member has\\none vote regardless of the number of his shares or the amount of his\\ndeposits. These members elect the officers. The committees and trustees\\n(and often even, the treasurer) serve without pay: so that the expenses\\nof the banks are, on the average, about $150 a year.\\n\\n_Third:_ The banks are _for_ the people. The farmers’ money is loaned\\nby the farmer to the farmer at a low rate of interest (usually 4 per\\ncent. to 6 per cent.); the shareholders receiving, on their shares,\\nthe same rate of interest that the borrowers pay on their loans. Thus\\nthe resources of all farmers are made available to each farmer, for\\nproductive purposes.\\n\\nThis democratic rural banking is not confined to Germany. As Henry W.\\nWolff says in his book on coöperative banks:\\n\\n“Propagating themselves by their own merits, little people’s\\ncoöperative banks have overspread Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary,\\nSwitzerland, Belgium. Russia is following up those countries; France\\nis striving strenuously for the possession of coöperative credit.\\nServia, Roumania, and Bulgaria have made such credit their own. Canada\\nhas scored its first success on the road to its acquisition. Cyprus,\\nand even Jamaica, have made their first start. Ireland has substantial\\nfirst-fruits to show of her economic sowings.\\n\\n“South Africa is groping its way to the same goal. Egypt has discovered\\nthe necessity of coöperative banks, even by the side of Lord Cromer’s\\npet creation, the richly endowed ‘agricultural bank.’ India has made\\na beginning full of promise. And even in far Japan, and in China,\\npeople are trying to acclimatize the more perfected organizations of\\nSchulze-Delitzsch and Raffeisen. The entire world seems girdled with a\\nring of coöperative credit. Only the United States and Great Britain\\nstill lag lamentably behind.”\\n\\n\\nBANKERS’ SAVINGS BANKS\\n\\nThe saving banks of America present a striking contrast to these\\ndemocratic banks. Our savings banks also have performed a great\\nservice. They have provided for the people’s funds safe depositories\\nwith some income return. Thereby they have encouraged thrift and have\\ncreated, among other things, reserves for the proverbial “rainy day.”\\nThey have also discouraged “old stocking” hoarding, which diverts the\\nmoney of the country from the channels of trade. American savings banks\\nare also, in a sense, banks _of_ the people; for it is the people’s\\nmoney which is administered by them. The $4,500,000,000 deposits in\\n2,000 American savings banks belong to about ten million people, who\\nhave an average deposit of about $450. But our savings banks are not\\nbanks _by_ the people, nor, in the full sense, _for_ the people.\\n\\n_First:_ American savings banks are not managed _by_ the people.\\nThe stock-savings banks, most prevalent in the Middle West and the\\nSouth, are purely commercial enterprises, managed, of course, by the\\nstockholders’ representatives. The mutual savings banks, most prevalent\\nin the Eastern states, have no stockholders; but the depositors have\\nno voice in the management. The banks are managed by trustees _for_\\nthe people, practically a self-constituted and self-perpetuating\\nbody, composed of “leading” and, to a large extent, public-spirited\\ncitizens. Among them (at least in the larger cities) there is apt to\\nbe a predominance of investment bankers, and bank directors. Thus the\\nthree largest savings banks of Boston (whose aggregate deposits exceed\\nthose of the other 18 banks) have together 81 trustees. Of these, 52\\nare investment bankers or directors in other Massachusetts banks or\\ntrust companies.\\n\\n_Second:_ The funds of our savings banks (whether stock or purely\\nmutual) are not used mainly _for_ the people. The depositors are\\nallowed interest (usually from 3 to 4 per cent.). In the mutual savings\\nbanks they receive ultimately all the net earnings. But the money\\ngathered in these reservoirs is not used to aid _productively_ persons\\nof the classes who make the deposits. The depositors are largely wage\\nearners, salaried people, or members of small tradesmen’s families.\\nStatically the money is used for them. Dynamically it is used for the\\ncapitalist. For rare, indeed, are the instances when savings banks\\nmoneys are loaned to advance productively one of the depositor class.\\nSuch persons would seldom be able to provide the required security;\\nand it is doubtful whether their small needs would, in any event,\\nreceive consideration. In 1912 the largest of Boston’s mutual savings\\nbanks--the Provident Institution for Savings, which is the pioneer\\nmutual savings bank of America--managed $53,000,000 of people’s\\nmoney. Nearly one-half of the resources ($24,262,072) was invested\\nin bonds--state, municipal, railroad, railway and telephone and in\\nbank stock; or was deposited in national banks or trust companies.\\nTwo-fifths of the resources ($20,764,770) were loaned on real estate\\nmortgages; and the average amount of a loan was $52,569. One-seventh\\nof the resources ($7,566,612) was loaned on personal security; and\\nthe average of each of these loans was $54,830. Obviously, the “small\\nman” is not conspicuous among the borrowers; and these large-scale\\ninvestments do not even serve the individual depositor especially\\nwell; for this bank pays its depositors a rate of interest lower than\\nthe average. Even our admirable Postal Savings Bank system serves\\nproductively mainly the capitalist. These postal saving stations are\\nin effect catch-basins merely, which collect the people’s money for\\ndistribution among the national banks.\\n\\n\\nPROGRESS\\n\\nAlphonse Desjardins of Levis, Province of Quebec, has demonstrated\\nthat coöperative credit associations are applicable, also, to at least\\nsome urban communities. Levis, situated on the St. Lawrence opposite\\nthe City of Quebec, is a city of 8,000 inhabitants. Desjardins himself\\nis a man of the people. Many years ago he became impressed with the\\nfact that the people’s savings were not utilized primarily to aid the\\npeople productively. There were then located in Levis branches of\\nthree ordinary banks of deposit--a mutual savings bank, the postal\\nsavings bank, and three incorporated “loaners”; but the people were\\nnot served. After much thinking, he chanced to read of the European\\nrural banks. He proceeded to work out the idea for use in Levis; and\\nin 1900 established there the first “credit-union.” For seven years\\nhe watched carefully the operations of this little bank. The pioneer\\nunion had accumulated in that period $80,000 in resources. It had made\\n2900 loans to its members, aggregating $350,000; the loans averaging\\n$120 in amount, and the interest rate 6 1/2 per cent. In all this time\\nthe bank had _not met with a single loss_. Then Desjardins concluded\\nthat democratic banking was applicable to Canada; and he proceeded\\nto establish other credit-unions. In the last 5 years the number of\\ncredit-unions in the Province of Quebec has grown to 121; and 19 have\\nbeen established in the Province of Ontario. Desjardins was not merely\\nthe pioneer. All the later credit-unions also have been established\\nthrough his aid; and 24 applications are now in hand requesting like\\nassistance from him. Year after year that aid has been given without\\npay by this public-spirited man of large family and small means, who\\nlives as simply as the ordinary mechanic. And it is noteworthy that\\nthis rapidly extending system of coöperative credit-banks has been\\nestablished in Canada wholely without government aid, Desjardins having\\ngiven his services free, and his travelling expenses having been paid\\nby those seeking his assistance.\\n\\nIn 1909, Massachusetts, under Desjardin’s guidance, enacted a law for\\nthe incorporation of credit-unions. The first union established in\\nSpringfield, in 1910, was named after Herbert Myrick--a strong advocate\\nof coöperative finance. Since then 25 other unions have been formed;\\nand the names of the unions and of their officers disclose that 11 are\\nJewish, 8 French-Canadian, and 2 Italian--a strong indication that the\\nimmigrant is not unprepared for financial democracy. There is reason\\nto believe that these people’s banks will spread rapidly in the United\\nStates and that they will succeed. For the coöperative building and\\nloan associations, managed by wage-earners and salary-earners, who\\njoined together for systematic saving and ownership of houses--have\\nprospered in many states. In Massachusetts, where they have existed for\\n35 years, their success has been notable--the number, in 1912, being\\n162, and their aggregate assets nearly $75,000,000.\\n\\nThus farmers, workingmen, and clerks are learning to use their little\\ncapital and their savings to help one another instead of turning over\\ntheir money to the great bankers for safe keeping, and to be themselves\\nexploited. And may we not expect that when the coöperative movement\\ndevelops in America, merchants and manufacturers will learn from\\nfarmers and workingmen how to help themselves by helping one another,\\nand thus join in attaining the New Freedom for all? When merchants and\\nmanufacturers learn this lesson, money kings will lose subjects, and\\nswollen fortunes may shrink; but industries will flourish, because the\\nfaculties of men will be liberated and developed.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nPresident Wilson has said wisely:\\n\\n“No country can afford to have its prosperity originated by a small\\ncontrolling class. The treasury of America does not lie in the brains\\nof the small body of men now in control of the great enterprises....\\nIt depends upon the inventions of unknown men, upon the originations\\nof unknown men, upon the ambitions of unknown men. Every country is\\nrenewed out of the ranks of the unknown, not out of the ranks of the\\nalready famous and powerful in control.”\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTranscriber’s Notes\\n\\n\\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\\n\\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\\nquotation marks retained.\\n\\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Other People\\'s Money, by Louis Dembitz Brandeis\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OTHER PEOPLE\\'S MONEY ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 57819-0.txt or 57819-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/7/8/1/57819/\\n\\nProduced by Turgut Dincer, Charlie Howard, and the Online\\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\\nfile was produced from images generously made available\\nby The Internet Archive)\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5.
